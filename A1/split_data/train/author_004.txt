It's Thanksgiving Day, you know, and Oakdale is going to play Georgetown College.
"Only to that old crank Miss Brant.
"I'm not positive about the first collection," muttered Nora.
"Now for the tug of war." As he spoke the door was opened by Mabel, who positively shook in her shoes when she saw her visitors.
Edna had, under pledge of secrecy, told it to a sophomore, who immediately told it to her dearest friend, and so the tale traveled until it reached Eleanor, with numerous additions, far from pleasing to her.
Every inch of the ground was familiar to Grace.
Whether or not she would be allowed to return was a question that occasioned a great deal of discussion among three lower classes of girls.
Suppose we go over now; that is, unless you girls have something else to do." It was decided at once that they could go, and soon the four chums were walking briskly down the street in the direction of "Heartsease." It was an Indian summer day and the girls congratulated themselves on having taken advantage of it.
Miriam Nesbit, Marian Barber, Eva Allen and Eleanor Savell were chosen as candidates and promptly notified to report at Jessica's home the next Thursday evening for initiation.
By this time girls began to arrive rapidly, and soon the locker-room hummed with the sound of fresh, young voices.
"Finally he went on a concert tour through the principal European cities, and she never saw him again.
"I'm going to explore a little in those woods yonder." "Don't go far," called Anne anxiously, as Grace turned to go.
I don't fancy being caught in the woods in bad weather.
Here come some of the girls." Though the time had seemed hours to Grace, her interview with Eleanor had lasted barely five minutes.
Be careful!" The four candidates gave four uncertain jumps and experienced the disagreeable sensation usually felt in attempting to jump downward when on level ground.
If the girls wished to ask any questions, she would answer them as far as possible.
"She told me so the night of the play," was Grace's answer.
But Eleanor had reckoned without her host, for there was one girl who had not as yet come to the front.
But it is more wonderful to make one's audience feel it, too.
"I might not do well at all with that kind of part." "Never fear, you'll be the star before you know it," said Nora.
I must leave you now.
Grace decided that she would have a talk with Eleanor after school.
"I was out of my office barely ten minutes," she said, "yet when I returned some one had ruthlessly torn the essay to bits and left the pieces piled in the middle of my desk.
Miss Tebbs then stated that on Friday afternoon after school there would be a "try out" for parts in the gymnasium, in order to find out what girls were most capable of doing good work in the cast.
Their blind wandering had taken them straight to the hunter's cabin.
Be careful what you do.
3 THE RANGE AND GRANGE HUSTLERS ON THE PLAINS; Or, Following the Steam Plows Across the Prairie.
Don't you think so?" asked Nora.
Besides, she would have had both High Schools on her side.
"I am not likely to forget it, either." "Well we are not apt to meet any more Napoleon Bonapartes out there," said Nora, referring to Grace's encounter with an escaped lunatic, fully narrated in "GRACE HARLOWE'S SOPHOMORE YEAR AT HIGH SCHOOL." They were nearing their destination when Anne suddenly exclaimed: "Look, girls.
"That's what comes of having a sister who belongs to a sorority.
After a moment's wait, Hippy, Reddy and David appeared, and were greeted with shouts of laughter.
It was passed to me by mistake." "Very likely," agreed Grace.
"I'll ask papa about it.
The name of ALTEMUS is a distinctive brand on the cover of a book, always ensuring the buyer of having a book that is up-to-date and fine throughout.
Allow me to introduce Mr.
3 THE HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' FISHING TRIP; Or, Dick & Co.
She had been on the point of telling.
She made a striking picture as she stood looking with apparent indifference at the girls about her.
In this new series Tom Reade and Harry Hazelton prove worthy of all the traditions of Dick & Co.
Calling to the girls who still remained to move their belongings to that side, Miss Tebbs hurried across the stage to find the janitor and see that the door was at once unlocked.
4 THE HIGH SCHOOL CAPTAIN OF THE TEAM; Or, Dick & Co.
Then she could get something pleasant to do through the summer vacation.
So, there is reason for her sad expression." "I once read, somewhere," said Jessica sentimentally, "that ''Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.'" "Humph!" said Nora.
"Let us feed him at once, and have peace," exclaimed Nora.
"The prize is a box of stationery bought at the ten-cent store, so I am anxious to win it," Nora informed them.
"As for me, I'm going to dream about the play." "Anne, I believe you have more love for the stage than you will admit," said Grace, laughing.
As members of the same sorority, I know that you can be trusted not to repeat what I shall tell you." In a few words Grace told the story of Eleanor's treachery, omitting, however, the part concerning Miss Thompson.
"I want to speak to you, Miss Tebbs," said Eleanor as the teacher paused, her hand on the doorknob.
Let me see what would be a good tune?" "'Rally Round the Flag,'" suggested Miriam Nesbit.
I wish to play Rosalind," said Eleanor with calm assurance.
4 THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL BOYS IN SUMMER ATHLETICS; Or, Dick & Co.
"But what do you girls intend to do with her, once you get her?
"'Phone the livery and tell them that I'm here.
"I could write the woman at the orphanage who was good to me.
"Forgive me, Miss Thompson," she said tremulously, "but I can tell you nothing." "You are doing wrong, Grace, in withholding your knowledge," said the older woman rather sternly, "and I am greatly displeased at your stubbornness.
"Had it not been for Miss Harlowe, there would have been a serious accident.
She had it made purposely.
She stood regarding the astonished girls with a fascinating little smile that was irresistible.
When she had read about a dozen lines he motioned for her to cease reading, said something to Miss Tebbs, who made an entry on her pad, and beckoned to the girl next to Marian to come forward.
"She has invited us, and it's our duty to call on her first.
He was filled with profound admiration for them.
I've studied with a tutor, so I'm pretty well up in mathematics and English.
But inwardly she was seething with rebellion toward Miss Thompson and hatred of the Phi Sigma Tau.
"She has the reputation of being one of the most hateful women in Oakdale.
There is talk of giving a Shakespearian play, with Miss Tebbs to engineer it, and the cast to be chosen from the three lower classes.
Then an animated discussion began, and the following Saturday was agreed upon, the weather permitting, as the best time to go.
This was unusual for Oakdale, as winter generally came with a rush before the middle of November, and treated the inhabitants of that northern city to a taste of zero weather long before the Christmas holidays.
"It fairly takes my breath.
You must have left before she got there, and, of course, she thought you did it purposely." "Oh, dear, what a mess," sighed Grace.
2 THE HIGH SCHOOL BOYS IN SUMMER CAMP; Or, The Dick Prescott Six Training for the Gridley Eleven.
"Those girls who are not in any way implicated in this matter are dismissed," she said.
Gray, if you keep on insisting that you are old?" said Grace.
I shan't----" "You shall," replied Grace, hugging her.
"I chose it because it sounded so much more expressive than to say, 'May my bones be crushed and my heart cut out if ever I am unfaithful to my vows.'" There was a general laugh at this, the girls agreeing that Grace's choice was infinitely less blood-thirsty.
"I haven't been out there since the spread last year," said Anne.
Her eyelids drooped---- "Well, I declare!" said the chief, as he turned from the telephone, for Grace was fast asleep.
"Count us in," said Eva and Marian in a breath.
No boy will willingly lay down an unfinished book in this series.
She had come from a little village forty miles south of Oakdale, was the oldest of a large family, her mother being a widow of very small means.
If she has, I'll tan her hide," said Miss Brant, with a threatening gesture.
"Last year the girls belonging to the present senior and junior classes met on this very spot and amicably disposed of a two-year-old class grudge.
Marian Barber, Miriam Nesbit and Eva Allen after agreeing to be at Jessica's, at eight o'clock, had gone their separate ways.
Grace's heart was with her class.
"Speaking of Miss Thompson, reminds me that I have something to tell you.
But Nora said she knew, positively, that Eleanor was entertaining some guests to-night, so I didn't wait.
Page 145, "Harlowe's" changed to "Harlowe" (Harlowe lost no) Page 175, word "ran" removed from text.
"We shall understand each other a little better." "Now, what do you think of Miss Eleanor?" cried Nora.
"What a delicate way of reminding me that I once was a freshman!" she exclaimed.
"I mean to win at tennis this afternoon," she said, "so I'm not going to waste my precious energy on such little stunts." After the midday luncheon had been disposed of, the entire class repaired to the tennis court at the east end of the park.
She drew a breath of relief when the eight girls were safely outside the study hall door.
She works for her board in the winter, and in the mill in the summer, and now that miserable Miss Brant is going to take her out of school, and she is getting along so well, too." "Isn't it a pity," said Anne, "that people like her can't understand that if a girl were allowed to finish her education, she could earn so much more in the long run than she could by working year after year in a mill?" "We might go to Miss Brant and explain that to her," said Nora.
"The sooner we get there the sooner we'll know." "Good morning, young ladies," said the judge, bowing with old-time gallantry as James ushered the eight girls into the library.
"You'll see enough of her during rehearsal.
Will you tell me yours?" "My name is Eleanor Savell," replied the new-comer, "and I have just come to Oakdale with my aunt.
She took you from the orphanage with the understanding that if you did not suit her she was to be allowed to send you back.
are the most popular high school boys in the land.
I believe she wants to talk to us about Eleanor Savell.
and a runabout decorated in blue and white, containing Eleanor and Edna Wright, bore down upon them at lightning speed.
2 THE MOTOR BOAT CLUB AT NANTUCKET; Or, The Mystery of the Dunstan Heir.
Now what's on your mind, Grace?" "They're going to rob old Judge Putnam," Grace burst forth incoherently.
"I hope they won't be cross at my asking for a drink.
After lunch there would be a tennis match, and then the girls could amuse themselves as they chose; the start home to be made about six o'clock.
She will explain to you about the giving out of the parts." There was an enthusiastic clapping of hands as Miss Thompson smiled and nodded to the girls, then left the room.
The latter flushed, then turned perfectly white with rage.
Picking up her pen, Eleanor wrote rapidly for a brief space, underlined what she had written, signed her name with a flourish, and, folding and addressing her note, sent it to Grace.
"Never mind her, dear," said Julia, slipping her arm about Grace, while the other girls gathered round with many expressions of displeasure at Eleanor's cruel speech.
On finding that Eleanor had no plausible excuse, but had absented herself merely because she felt like it, Miss Thompson thereupon delivered a sharp little lecture on unnecessary absence, informing Eleanor that it was the rule of the school to present a written excuse for absence, and that a verbal excuse would not be accepted.
"Girls, I have never told you about what happened that night.
That is, if I survive." With a gay little nod, and a dazzling smile that revealed almost perfect teeth, she walked quickly down the long room and out the door, leaving the girl chums staring after her.
"Why should I have sacrificed the star to my own personal vanity?
Be good children, and----" She was interrupted by an exultant shriek, and a second later five girls appeared as by magic and gleefully surrounded the rescue party.
But you have with you seven girls who do know all about the enmity that was buried here last spring, and who ought to have enough good sense to know that this afternoon's performance is liable to bring it to life again.
"Won't it be fun?" exclaimed Grace joyously, as she walked down the street, the center of the Phi Sigma Tau.
"Why, David Nesbit, how can you make such statements?" replied Grace, looking at the young man in mock disapproval.
"I consider that a compliment," replied Nora, laughing.
"It's the oath of office taken by the President of the United States at inauguration, only you changed it to suit this sorority." "You've guessed it exactly," replied Grace.
"I've been waiting to see you ever since the play was over," said Eleanor sullenly.
The face turned toward her was that of Mabel Allison, the freshman prize girl.
What did she give you?" "Nothing," replied Anne.
"I hope he didn't recognize us.
"Am I speaking to Miss Brant?" "I guess likely you are," responded the woman, "and you better state your business now, for I've no time to fool away on strangers." "You have a young girl with you by the name of Mabel Allison, have you not?" asked Mr.
My aunt is dining with Mrs.
"Be merciful to the candidates." Lifting his cap, the young man hurried off and turned the corner without looking back.
Whoever was contemptible enough to engage in such mischief must have known this.
"She says she is deeply insulted because we didn't invite her, but that she didn't intend to come, at any rate.
"Don't be frightened," whispered Grace, taking her hand.
Tom gave a dinner to his roommate, inviting "the seven originals," as he expressed it, and Miriam, who felt that at last she really belonged in the charmed circle.
Those who have followed the "High School Girls" through three years of school life cannot fail to be interested in what befell these lovable everyday girls during their senior year.
If you are seen, the girls are apt to ask questions that you may find hard to answer truthfully." "Thank goodness, David and Tom taught me something about automobiles last summer," thought Grace as she prepared to start, "or I should have been powerless to help Anne to-night.
It's as plain as can be.
"If you know any young men who can make themselves useful, we might invite them.
1 THE HIGH SCHOOL FRESHMEN; Or, Dick & Co.'s First Year Pranks and Sports.
"Some one had to do something," she said weakly.
"Pile into it and we'll be up there in a jiffy." "It's awfully late," demurred Grace.
I am a sea of gurgling glee, with ecstacy on tap.'" Hippy recited this effusion in a killing falsetto voice, and endeavored to embrace Reddy fervently, but was dragged back by Tom and David, to Reddy's visible relief.
So she threatened revenge, did she?" "Yes," replied Grace.
I think it's a shame, too.
He lost no time in cultivating Miriam's acquaintance, and the two soon became firm friends.
The Meadow-Brook Girls Series =By JANET ALDRIDGE= Real live stories pulsing with the vibrant atmosphere of outdoor life.
The present freshmen, direct from the Grammar Schools, sat on the front seats looking a trifle awed at the idea of being academic pupils, and feeling very strange and uncomfortable under the scrutiny of so many pairs of eyes.
She had dressed the dolls with the idea of contrasting the first Thanksgiving with that of to-day.
"They have trowels," Julia informed them from time to time.
Julia was studying hard, she told Grace.
We shall probably use about fifty girls, thus making it an elaborate production.
"Second the motion," said Eva Allen.
The old lady had become so accustomed to the sympathetic presence of the quiet, young girl that it seemed, at times, as though her own daughter had come back to her once more.
"I shall," said Anne quietly.
1 THE RANGE AND GRANGE HUSTLERS ON THE RANCH; Or, The Boy Shepherds of the Great Divide.
Henceforth there would again be two distinct factions in the junior class.
"Your mother knows you can take care of yourself.
"Do you think you will go to school to-morrow, Eleanor?
"Hippy can go, I'm sure," said Nora.
Nevertheless, the enemy has retired in confusion." CHAPTER XI WORRIES AND PLANS Although the girls belonging to Julia's party were silent concerning what happened at the Omnibus House, the story leaked out, creating considerable discussion among the members of the two upper classes.
David was even more pleased than his sister over the turn affairs had taken.
She seemed delighted when I asked her to join our society." "As long as we know she isn't coming, don't you think we should begin the initiation?" asked Nora.
There was a general scramble for the ball, and for five minutes neither team scored; then Marian Barber dropped a neat field goal, and soon after Grace scored on a foul.
The sophomore year had been crowded with many trials, some of them positive school tragedies, in which Anne and Grace had been the principal actors.
The branding was done with a piece of ice, pressed hard against their bare arms, and the shock made the victims gasp for a second and wonder if they really were being burned.
Yet if she did write the note, she should have realized that going to Mrs.
"Anne and Nora already know it.
"You look like a garden of roses.
With a half-stifled sob, Grace hurried from the room.
She had entered the High School in the junior class, determining to graduate and then to work her way through Normal School.
Ignoring Eleanor's final remark, Miss Thompson once more turned her attention to the matter in hand.
She looked shy and embarrassed when she saw the four girls bearing down upon her, and seemed half inclined to run away.
"Oh, what a mess," groaned Grace.
Original read "surprise ran around" (surprise around) Page 254, "your" changed to "you're" (you know you're) The Boys of Steel Series: Book list was missing the numerals 3 and 4.
It's time she put in an appearance." "Just listen to Grandmother Bright," teased Anne.
Our green and callow days are over, and we have entered into the realm of the upper classes." "Then I shall enter the junior class, too, for I choose to hob-nob with you girls.
"But stop teasing me, and let Mrs.
Southard wishes to congratulate her and you, too." "She'll be out in a couple of minutes," said Grace, as she advanced to greet the great actor.
She'll be a junior when I'm a freshman.
It was over at last, and Oakdale had won a complete victory over the Georgetown foe, who took their defeat with becoming grace.
Still standing, she reached down, picked up a book from her desk and took from it a paper.
CHAPTER VII THE CLAIM OF THE "ARTISTIC TEMPERAMENT" When Eleanor returned to school the following morning, she found that what Miss Thompson "disliked" was, after all, of considerable importance.
She used to call me 'fatty' when I was little, and I've never forgiven her.
It was over at last.
"Let us howl in peace.
Miss Savell had a bad case of stage fright and almost had to be dragged on.
I supposed she was a great friend of yours." "She was, but she isn't," returned Grace.
I wonder what I can do for her to show her that I appreciate her bravery?" "I don't believe she'd accept anything, Judge," replied the chief.
So that was what all the whispering and mystery had meant.
She didn't seem to mind it," remarked Jessica.
And we'll drive the senior foe, from the basket every time.
"This morning I overheard certain girls planning to go out to the Omnibus House after school to-morrow and dig up the poor hatchet and flaunt it in the seniors' faces the day of the opening basketball game, simply to rattle us.
Don't come down on her like an avalanche." Mabel, however, was equal to the occasion.
They had not waited long before they heard voices.
After Miss Nevin had gone, Mrs.
"We acquired the habit of dining late from living on the continent.
As at Thanksgiving, each member of the sorority entertained two or more girls on Christmas and New Year's, and were amply repaid for their good deed by the warm appreciation of their guests.
"How can you bear to think of cutting up live cats and dogs and angleworms and things." "Oh, you silly," laughed Grace.
During the winter, theatrical companies sometimes visited Oakdale for a week at a time, presenting, at popular prices, old worn-out plays and cheap melodramas.
As charter members, they would initiate four other girls, as soon as proper rites could be thought of.
They lost their count, bumped each other at every turn, and at last staggered dizzily toward what they thought were the corners of the room.
Her proposition was hailed with acclamation by Anne, Nora and Jessica.
Eleanor," she exclaimed, turning to the weeping girl, "is your runabout outside?" "Yes," sobbed Eleanor.
Almost numberless letters have been received by the publishers, making this eager demand; for Dick Prescott, Dave Darrin, Tom Reade, and the other members of Dick & Co.
"YOUR SINCERE FRIENDS." At recess Grace showed the note to her friends.
She said it took her six weeks to prepare it on account of the time she spent in looking up her facts.
You know what a temper Ruth Deane has and how ferocious she can look?
Nora sang, Anne recited, Grace and Miriam did a Spanish dance that they had practised during vacation with remarkable spirit and effect.
It was plain to be seen that in spite of the rival faction, Grace held first place in the hearts of most of her class.
I have been there with her, and I love every bit of it.
Miss Tebbs moved toward the door, but as she placed her hand on the knob Grace sprang eagerly forward.
Grace Harlowe felt a load lifted from her mind when Miss Thompson publicly announced that she had not received any information from either Mabel Allison or the Phi Sigma Tau.
The moment Miss Tebbs ceased talking the girls began, as they gathered in little groups around the lucky ones and gave vent to their feelings with many exclamations of approval and congratulation.
Stand up straight and let me brush your coat.
Long live the president of the Phi Sigma Tau." Miriam, flushed with pleasure, then took the seat that Grace had vacated.
It seems an age since breakfast." A halt was made and the contents of two of the lunch packages were arranged on a little tablecloth at the foot of a great oak.
Grace had fully intended that Miriam should play center, but when she proposed it, Miriam flatly refused to do so, and asked for her old position of right forward.
3 DICK PRESCOTT'S THIRD YEAR AT WEST POINT; Or, Standing Firm for Flag and Honor.
The judge's got money in the house, too.
Miriam Nesbit was elected vice president, Marian Barber treasurer, and, rather to Grace's surprise, Eleanor was chosen as secretary, Edna Wright again nominating her after doing some vigorous whispering among the two back rows of girls.
Nora, Marian Barber and Eva Allen were strongly opposed to sending it.
"Sit down and be comfy and I'll play for you.
I think we had better hurry.
Doesn't she look great as Jaques?
"There are two girls on the sophomore and three on the freshman team whose basketball ardor will have to cool until after the mid-year exams." "You might know that some of those silly freshmen would get into trouble," said Nora scornfully.
"Grace," said Tom in a husky voice, "that was the quickest move I ever saw any one make." Grace drew a long breath, the color returned to her pale face and in a measure she recovered herself.
"If we can get her away from that hateful old wretch, the sorority could adopt her.
When she is twenty-one her aunt will tell her about him.
The thing to do would be to find out what girls could most ably portray the various characters, it would be necessary to try each girl separately with a few lines from the play.

Many stories, too, are so highly improbable as to bring a grin of derision to the young reader's face before he has gone far.
It was ten minutes of nine.
Our gallant team now takes its stand, And all the baskets soon will land.
Darlington's books breathe forth every phase of an intensely interesting and exciting life.
"The special teachers report to her every day.
IRVING HANCOCK= "Give us more Dick Prescott books!" This has been the burden of the cry from young readers of the country over.
If we could only get Mabel away from her.
The reaction had set in the moment she realized that Mabel was safe.

Hippy, David and Reddy have a new one, too.
"Eleanor," said Grace solemnly, "you ought to be a very happy girl.
He can carry them in a paper bag and----" But before he could say more he was seized by David and Reddy and rushed unceremoniously into the street, while the girls signified their approbation by cries of "good enough for him" and "make him promise to behave to-morrow night." "I will.
They were to forfeit their recess, library and all other privileges until the end of the term.
"'We have met the enemy and they are ours.' Tell us about it quickly.
It had been untenanted for some time, as the owners were in Europe, although both house and grounds were looked after by a care-taker.
"She is going to live at 'Heartsease' and---- oh, Mrs.
We are all going up to Nesbit's for a jollification given in honor of Rosalind, who is at present dressed in everyday clothes and shaking hands with the great Southard.

She said she'd come sometime when she felt like it.
"You see this is our senior year, and we are going to enter the same college next year, if all goes well.
I supposed the highway was for vehicles, not pedestrians four abreast." "Miss Savell, you have just missed running over Miss Allison," said Miriam coldly.
As for responsibility, it is a good thing to learn to be responsible for one's self, if for no one else." "Well, perhaps you are right, but I am sure that if you had never lived long enough in one country to become acclimated, you wouldn't feel very responsible, either," said Eleanor in such rueful tones that the girls laughed, although they secretly disapproved of Eleanor's inconsequential attitude.
"I wonder what play is to be chosen, and if it is to be given for the school only?" "The play hasn't been decided upon yet," replied Grace, "but the object of it is to get some money for new books for the school library.
Her glance wandered toward the new sophomore class, as though in search of some one, her eyes brightening as she caught sight of the brown-eyed girl who had won the freshman prize the previous June.
When they had been married for about a year and a half he played before the king, and soon became the man of the hour.
"It's your turn to come and see us now," said Grace.
"When I told her that I stayed at home because I felt inclined to do so, she almost had a spasm, and gave me another lecture then and there, ending up by saying that it must not occur again.
"Is your aunt Miss Margaret Nevin?" asked Anne quietly.
No other girls, with the exception of Nora, had been allowed to read as much of any scene as they two had been requested to read.
"Don't you wish you knew?" teased Grace.
Grace inwardly congratulated herself on having kept clear of the whole thing.
"Just listen to this, girls!" she exclaimed, and read: "'TO THE PHI SIGMA TAU: "'After initiating me into your ridiculous society, you have seen fit to call a meeting of the members without directly notifying me, therefore I wish to withdraw from your sorority, as I feel that I have been deeply insulted.
I don't believe their society will last long, at any rate.
"She doesn't deserve your regret and is too selfish to appreciate it.
Five minutes later the match was over.
Go into any bookstore and ask for an Altemus book.
After conducting opening exercises, Miss Thompson pronounced sentence on the culprits.
Then he again held conversation with Miss Tebbs, who nodded and looked smilingly toward Nora, who stood scowling faintly, rather ill-pleased at attracting so much attention.
It was with a light heart that Grace Harlowe ate her breakfast and flitted about the house, putting a final touch here and there before receiving her guests.
Gray's private secretary," explained Jessica.
She still despised Miss Thompson as thoroughly as on the day that she had manifested her open scorn and dislike for the principal.
Next to Anne, Nora, perhaps, came second.
Grace stood staring about her in blank dismay.
It looks like----" She stopped suddenly, a shocked look creeping into her eyes.
The main thing to be considered was the intelligent delivery of the great dramatist's lines.
She wondered if there were to be many new girls that year.
"Who are the girls, Julia?
"Wonder where the fellows went.
"That would fill her with joy." "Then we'll see that she goes away in a gloomy frame of mind," said Nora, "for we're going to win, and don't you forget to remember it." Just then the whistle blew, and there was a scramble for places.
The square was practically deserted, but under one of the great trees, curled up on a bench, was a girl.
"And I'll not stop for an instant until I notify the police." Grace never forgot that lonely walk.
"'O joy, O bliss, O rapture!
"Eleanor started that paper, whatever it is," said Nora O'Malley to the Phi Sigma Tau, who stood in a group around her desk.
"However, you shan't find out from me.
The initiation is about to begin.
Besides, he is playing a three-night engagement in Albany.
"Just before the last half started, Miss Thompson and Miss Kane came in and walked to the other end of the gallery.
"I shall never forget the first football game I saw in Oakdale," said Anne to David as they made their way to the grandstand.
Then they all started in wild pursuit of a rabbit, and in consequence had difficulty in finding the road again.
Once on the street a lively confab ensued, all talking at once.
But she had lost her sense of direction, and after fifteen minutes' wandering was about to despair of finding her way, when she espied the honeysuckle bush that she had stripped earlier in the afternoon.

"I knew she'd make good." "Are they all there, Grace," anxiously inquired Miss Tebbs.
"This woman cannot hold your little friend.
He repeated the whistle again and again.
"I don't know about that," remarked Nora O'Malley.
"He is not liable to trouble me again, however, because he knows that I will not go back to the stage, no matter what he says.
CHAPTER XVI THE JUNIORS FOREVER When the four classes assembled Thursday morning, every girl, with the exception of Eleanor, was in her seat.
"I don't blame you," said Grace sympathetically.
Miriam Nesbit as the "Duke" looked particularly fine, and the girls gathered around her with many exclamations of admiration.
I know Eleanor was mixed up in it." "Of course," nodded Nora, and turned her attention to the meeting just in time to hear Grace put the motion for the picnic and say "aye" with the others.
Miss Thompson has promised me the gymnasium.
Where did you put your costumes?
The orchestra will accompany you." There was considerable subdued laughter from the orchestra, who had been instructed to play "The Star Spangled Banner," oblivious of whatever the candidates might sing.
The very name of the society was shrouded in mystery, though Nora O'Malley was heard to declare that she had no doubt it was a branch of the "Black Hand." Eleanor was the acknowledged leader, but Edna Wright became a close second, and between them they managed to disseminate a spirit of mischief throughout the school that the teachers found hard to combat.
Couldn't Anne use that?" "Impossible, Grace," said Miss Tebbs.
"I'll settle with you later." With gay laughter and jest, the young folks made their way from the grounds and started down the road toward home.
"Who on earth is that girl?" inquired Reddy Brooks.
What do you suppose the latest is?" "If you know anything new, it is your duty to tell us at once, without making us beg for it," said Nora reprovingly.
"They actually managed to stop and turn around, and now they are coming this way.
She was wearing a fur coat and hat far too costly for a school girl, and carried a huge muff.
"On the contrary," replied Mr.
If, during this time, any one of them should be reported for a misdemeanor, they were to be suspended without delay.
"Yesterday she treated us as though we were her dearest friends, while to-day she scorns us utterly.
You will spoil the whole production by appearing in an incorrect or misfit costume, besides bitterly disappointing the two girls who will have to give up their costumes to you.
"Remember, I rely upon you," whispered Mrs.
I would have advised you before this to leave her, but you are too young to drift about the world alone.
I move therefore that we choose Miriam Nesbit for president of this sorority.
"From the day of his marriage he chased golf balls," concluded Hippy, "and the habit became so firmly fixed with him that he even rose and chased them in his sleep.
Anne stopped to pick some ground berries she found nestling under the leaves.
But she is perfectly awful, and I wish I were dead." Her voice ended almost in a wail.
"Be sure and be on hand early." Grace chose Anne, Nora, Jessica and Marian Barber, the latter three being considerably mystified at her request, but nevertheless agreeing to be on hand when school closed.
"However, I want you to read this." Grace took the paper, looking rather perplexed, and read: "Ask Miss Harlowe what she was doing in your office between half past one and a quarter of two yesterday." "A PASSERBY." "Why--why----" stammered Grace, her eyes growing large with wonder.
They had decided at recess to carry away as many laurels as possible, providing they could get into the cast.

"I always hate passing this old house," said Marian Barber.
David promised to get me the tickets.
"I wonder who did tell Miss Thompson.
But Jessica, Anne and Miriam agreed with Grace that it would be in fulfillment of the original promise to Mrs.
"Remember, girls, basketball practice again to-morrow, and the rest of the week.
Bright courteously, as they stepped into the narrow hall.
"Where is her father now?" asked Anne.
It was of Italian cloth in a beautiful shade of dark red, made in one piece, with a yoke of red and gold net, and trimmed with tiny enameled buttons.
The information given is exact and truthful; above all, each story is full of adventure and fascination.
"Esteemed juniors and fellow-citizens," said Grace, after calling the meeting to order.
Eleanor is an uncommon girl in many respects.
I have heard so much about you, but I never dreamed that you'd ever speak to me." "Nonsense," replied Grace, laughing.
The Boys of Steel Series =By JAMES R.
Those girls are sure to quarrel among themselves, and that will end the whole thing.
She is beautiful and fascinating, but I don't know whether I like her or not." "You must like her," said Grace.
I know I used to do it.
She was very indignant over it and sent me back in the carriage, telling the coachman to return for her, for of course she will be here to-night.
Then Grace said gently, although she felt irritated at Eleanor's careless speech: "I don't think Mabel Allison could really be called a beggar; and if we adopt her, we ought never to let her think that we consider her a dependent.
"You won't find her at all disagreeable.
"What's the matter, Eleanor?" she asked.
I won't attempt to read all the letter, only that part that interests us.
She must be awfully clever, too, to know so many languages, but----" "But what?" queried Nora.
Grace captured it, however, and sent it flying toward Miriam, who was so carefully guarded that she dared not attempt to make the basket, and after a feint managed to throw it to Nora, who tried for the basket at long range and missed.
She had a word or smile for each one, and the new girls who had at first felt rather timid about meeting her, were soon entirely at ease in her presence.
I believe I can find those costumes yet.
Please be good and don't follow me.
I will not tolerate such behavior." Eleanor glared at the principal, whose face was rigid in its purpose, then sank into the nearest vacant seat, saying defiantly: "You may keep me here all night if you like, but, I meant what I said, and I shall retract nothing." Nevertheless she did not again attempt to leave the room.
"Be sure and put your costumes exactly where they belong," called Miss Tebbs as the girls filed off the stage into the dressing room after the final curtain.
"And now I hope I shall have no occasion to deliver another lecture during the school year," said the principal, smiling.
"I am so glad you waited," said Grace cordially.
I am disappointed because she will not be here to-night.
Southard to go in her carriage, Miss Tebbs.
Before school, at recess, and even in classes it was the topic of the hour.
Just then the bell sounded and the girls returned to their seats with the riddle still unsolved.
Gray yesterday and they were in the parlor together for a long time.
Tom divided the party into two sections, four in one and five in the other.
"Hardly a recitation passes in my class without some kind of disturbance, and it is always traced to one of the girls in that crowd.
It merely proves you to be greater hypocrites than you at first seemed.
"'Twas many and many a year ago, In an age beyond recall, That Nora, the freshman, lowly sat At one end of the study hall." recited Anne Pierson in dramatic tones.
Do you own this property?" "Mercy, no," replied Julia composedly.
Bright with great ceremony to the arm chair in the corner, Grace established him with many low bows, much to the amusement of the girls, with whom Jessica's father was a great favorite.
Judge Putnam was greatly agitated over the affair.
"Then you will have no trouble to-morrow night.
"I always suspected Edna Wright's lack of sense," whispered Nora to Jessica.
You are the first, however." "Why are we to hold a meeting?" asked Nora, her curiosity aroused.
"I see that I shall be obliged to call Miss Thompson back here and tell her who destroyed her essay.
The matron asked her why she did not adopt you, or at least appoint herself your guardian, and she said that under no circumstances would she do so; that she wanted a good maid of all work, not a daughter.
"Now let's forget him and have a good time." "Hurrah!
Grace stood silently waiting until the other should find her voice.
"Miss Savell," said the principal quietly, although her flashing eyes and set lips showed that she was very angry, "if you have that paper in your possession, bring it to me at once, and never answer me again as you did just now.
No one has been killed and only one wounded.
Now I must leave you, for I have a very important engagement at home." "In the laboratory, I suppose," said Anne teasingly.
The game ended with the score 15 to 6 in favor of the juniors, whose loyal supporters swooped down upon them the moment the whistle blew and pranced about, whooping like savages.
This was served at two long tables in the dining room, Mrs.
I tried to find out where she was going, but she wouldn't tell me.
To the readers of "GRACE HARLOWE'S PLEBE YEAR AT HIGH SCHOOL," and "GRACE HARLOWE'S SOPHOMORE YEAR AT HIGH SCHOOL," the girl chums have become familiar figures.
"Vertical writing all looks alike.

Words fail to express my feelings.
"You may not believe it," he said between calls, "but the hunter who taught me this, told me never to use it unless I was in dire need.
Immediately after this the classes were dismissed, and a general rush was made to the end of the great room, where the bulletins were posted.
"Don't you dare leave my house with any of my property, you baggage," she hissed.
What are you talking about, my child?" asked the chief.
"Here comes Miss Tebbs now." She stepped courteously aside to allow the teacher to enter the dressing room, then, following her, closed the door.
Now that the excitement was over, Grace felt her anger rising.
"That was the greatest game I ever saw played under this roof," cried David, wringing Grace's hand, while Hippy hopped about, uttering little yelps of joy.
Then we'll look through the hole in the curtain at the house.
Exercising the greatest care in sliding it back, she lifted the latch.
When the bell rang at the close of the hour, Eleanor walked haughtily by Miss Ames, giving her a contemptuous look as she passed that made the teacher tighten her lips and look severe.
That would be both unfair and unjust.
Gray seems to think we can be of some use in that direction, so we are trying to carry out her theory." "I think I understand the situation," said Miriam Nesbit, "and will do all I can to be nice to her, if she doesn't attempt to patronize me.
I suppose you have written more than one letter to Miss Savell's aunt, haven't you, Anne!" "Yes, indeed," replied Anne.
All this Eleanor had heard, among other things, from Edna Wright, but had paid little attention to it when Edna had told her.
"When first you came to High School, I promised Mrs.
"Miss Tebbs is going to call the meeting to order." A hush fell over the assembled girls as Miss Tebbs stepped forward to address them.
There was a cry of horror from the young folks that ended in a sigh of relief.
Just then she caught the sound of rough voices just outside the cottage.
The juniors had all received copies of the words and had learned them by heart.
I think it would do you good to have a girl of your own age in the house." "Three cheers for Mr.
6 THE PONY RIDER BOYS IN NEW MEXICO; Or, The End of the Silver Trail.
It was the first time that the once haughty Miriam had ever referred publicly to past shortcomings, although from the time she and Grace had settled their difficulties at the close of the sophomore year, she had been a changed girl.
I heard it at commencement, but I have forgotten it." Taking a leaf from a little note-book that she always carried, Grace wrote: "Do you see the freshman-prize girl over among the sophomores?
The girls, uttering little cries of alarm, scattered to both sides of the road, with the exception of Mabel Allison, who, in her hurry to get out of the way, stumbled and fell directly in the path of the oncoming machine.
I must go back to your principal and announce myself ready to meet my fate.
"You gave up your part for me.
You are here to make mischief and we are here to prevent it, and, furthermore, are going to do so." "What do you mean?" retorted Eleanor, her eyes flashing.
"What shall I do?" "Where are they?" asked Grace, with compressed lips.
Two of them were from Portville, a small town about seventy miles from Oakdale, and had begun High School with Grace, who had been too busy with her own affairs up to the present to find out much about them.
As the four chums hurried toward the gymnasium, Anne suddenly caught Grace by the arm with a faint gasp of surprise.
Gray was entertaining Miss Nevin, and the truth came out.
We'll support you, only you must agree to do all the talking." "I shall endeavor to overcome their insane freshness with a few well-chosen words," Julia promised.
"I know perfectly well that David Nesbit won't go away.
"And why is she called Savell, if her name is Savelli?" "Because, my dear, her father has never evinced the slightest desire to look up his own child.
CHAPTER II CONFIDENCES "I am the bearer of an invitation," announced Anne Pierson as the four girls collected in one corner of the locker-room during the brief recess allowed each morning.
Eleanor's thirst for glory and revenge had been the means of losing Grace the part that she had so eagerly looked forward to playing, not to mention the narrow escape Anne had run.
After we adopted Mabel Allison, we began looking about us for other fish to fry, and found out about these girls.
Your part of Celia is very well suited to you, and you can win plenty of applause playing it.
Now, the way I propose doing it is this: I have a camp up in the Adirondacks that needs attention, so I wrote my youngest sister about it and she agrees with me.
"Here she is," shrieked Nora in delight.
You can send her back her ridiculous things.
With her, going into a game meant winning it.
"I should love to hear you play on the violin.
The dialogue was clever, and the action of the sketch so ridiculous that the audience laughed from the first line until the climax, especially when the suffragette was hustled off to jail by Tom Gray, in the rôle of a policeman, for disturbing the peace, while her husband and child executed a wild dance of joy as she was hauled off the scene, protesting vigorously.
She wanted to save my clothes for me, thinking that by them I might some day find my parents, but the matron took them away from her, all but three little gold baby pins marked 'M.I.A.' She hid them away from the matron.
"You ought to get it." "Not in a Shakespearian play," replied Anne, shaking her head.
"Ethel Post wants me to go to Wellesley.
"I'll effectually attend to their case.
The clothing now worn by Miss Mabel will be returned to you in due season.
You have refused our friendship and have been the means of estranging Miss Thompson and myself.
Then listen to me, for I've walked all the way from Forest Park and there's no time to lose." "Walked from Forest Park?" exclaimed the chief, as he turned to the 'phone.
She had met with a will stronger than her own and she realized it.
She hurried back to where Miss Tebbs and the three chums awaited her, followed by the curious eyes of a number of the cast, who wondered vaguely why Grace Harlowe was rushing around at such a rate.
"What ails her to-day?" whispered Nora to Jessica.
"For if you don't instantly tell me where they are, I shall call the whole cast and expose you." "If you do, you will merely make yourself ridiculous," hissed Eleanor, her eyes blazing.
When I saw you girls the first day of school, I thought that you were full of life and spirit, but really you are all goody-goodies, who allow those teachers to lead you around by the nose.
"Part of the sacred obligations of the 'Knights and Squires' frat.
"I shall certainly find out more about that child," she decided.
Bright, bowing politely, motioned to the three young girls to precede him, and the party went quietly down the walk, leaving Miss Brant in the open door, shaking her fist and uttering dire threats.
After due consideration, we decided that 'As You Like It' is better suited to our needs than any of the other Shakespearian dramas.
"I am sure Rosalind will be safe with you, for few professional women could have done better.
She wanted me to stay there with her and didn't seem to understand why I couldn't break my engagement with you girls.
"Something that concerns you and your friends, and you mustn't say 'no' to an old man." "What on earth does he mean?" said Grace to her chums, as she repeated the judge's words.
"You are hurting my arm.
Each new set of contestants seemed funnier than the preceding one.
"But it's such a quare name on the outside, I be wondering if it's fur yerself and no other?" Jessica looked at the envelope.
They expected her to live up to her reputation and she had scarcely delivered the opening line before they realized that she would not disappoint them.
Her name is Mary Stevens, and she would surely know!" "Then write to her at once," said Grace, "and tell her to send her letter in an outside envelope addressed to me.
It will take me less than six minutes to dispose of it." Seizing the essay with both hands, she tore it across, and then tore it again and again, until it was literally reduced to shreds.
"How I would love to take part in it!" "You will, without doubt, if there is a try out," replied Grace.
Things ran along smoothly until Edith met a young Italian named Guido Savelli, who was studying the violin at the same conservatory.
"We appreciate the fact that you are too polite to vote for yourself, Miriam," said Grace, "but your 'no' doesn't amount to a row of pins.
I wanted her to like every bit of our school life and thought she'd surely be interested in basketball.
"We don't want you to tell.
"Still I'm not much afraid.
She talked for a moment to Edna and Eleanor.
"Very well," laughed Grace, "as we are all of the same mind, let's shed these books and be off." After a brief stop at Grace's home, the four girls started out, keenly alive to the beauty of the day.
Reddy minced along in a bonnet and skirt belonging to Mrs.
DURHAM= These splendid books for boys and girls deal with life aboard submarine torpedo boats, and with the adventures of the young crew, and possess, in addition to the author's surpassing knack of storytelling, a great educational value for all young readers.
She has been so distant of late." "Don't wait to ask her," said Nora decidedly.
Grace was overjoyed at the idea of seeing Tom Gray again.
"High School boys, on a lark," whispered Grace to her friends.
"As long as you retain your Irish independence what do you care about what other girls do?" "I don't care.
It's getting late, too, and the girls will soon be going back.
Has anyone seen that Allison child?
She hasn't used it much of late." "How beautiful she looked to-night, didn't she?" interposed Jessica.
A barrier seemed to have sprung up between them, that only one thing could remove, but Grace was resolved not to expose Eleanor--not that she felt that Eleanor did not richly deserve it, but she knew that it would mean instant expulsion from school.
Let me introduce you to my friends." She named her three chums in turn, who bowed cordially to the attractive stranger.
In "GRACE HARLOWE'S SOPHOMORE YEAR," the girl chums were found leading their class in athletics.
"Hello-o-o!" "Where are you?" called Tom.
"What a delightful place 'Heartsease' is," cried Grace as she paused just inside the gate to feast her eyes upon its beauty.
The only way to be happy is to----" "Please don't preach to me," said Eleanor haughtily.
She is willing for us to do whatever we think best.
So we just kept quiet." "I don't know what is to be done, I'm sure," said Miss Tebbs in an anxious tone.
I suppose it's only superstition, but I love hunter's lore.
The only thing I could promise you would be to allow you to understudy Rosalind in case anything happened to Miss Pierson.
He'll tell every one in school about it." "I don't think he did," replied Grace.
"Are you talking of the would-be murderess, who froze us all out Thanksgiving Day?" asked Hippy.
"You know where Anne's costumes are.
"I didn't mean to slight her.
The seniors moved with evident pride into the places reserved for the first class, while the freshmen looked visibly relieved at having any place at all to call their own.
Your whole future depends upon her answer." Grace thereupon related to her their conversation of the previous night.
Rather surprised at receiving an answer so quickly, Grace unfolded the note.
That's why I stopped in the square." "Beat you!" exclaimed Grace.
You know Miss Thompson is awfully down on 'skipping school.' She threatened last year to suspend Edna Wright for it." "There will be weeping and wailing in the 'Skull and Crossbones' crowd,'" exclaimed Nora.
Bright, as the two girls entered his office, "I see you are prompt in keeping your appointment.
So they strolled along, laughing and chatting in the care-free manner that belongs alone to the school girl.
She doesn't seem much interested in school and I don't think she is particularly impressed with our sorority." "Anne," said Jessica, "you have seen Miss Nevin, her aunt.
By the attendance this afternoon I should imagine that you are heartily in favor of our project and that we shall have no trouble in making up the cast.
I despise you, because you are a ridiculous prig, and I am glad of an opportunity to tell you so.
Many are the claims made as to the inexpensiveness of books.
She faltered a little on the first two lines, but shortly regained her courage and read on in her best manner.
We mustn't spoil the party." "I move that we give Grace Harlowe a special round of applause for being a heroine," cried Hippy.
She has the music madness of both father and mother.
"Are you afraid it will run away, little Miss Fussbudget!" "No; of course not," said Anne, smiling.
The spectators had not yet begun to arrive, as it was still early, so the girls indulged in a little warming-up practice, did a few stunts and skipped about, overflowing with animal spirits.
Southard and Miss Tebbs joined.
Give them what they deserve, Julia." "Never fear," replied Julia.
Reddy's on the team, but Hippy and I will do the honors." "Fine," replied Grace.
He had all that heart could wish; still he was not happy, for, alas, he was too fat." At this statement there was a shout of laughter from his listeners, at which Hippy, pretending anger, glared ferociously and vowed that he would not continue.
I am certain that if you think back for an instant you will realize that you have forfeited all right to object." For a moment Miss Brant stood speechless with anger, then in her wrath she poured forth such a flood of abuse that the rescue party stared in amazement.
Forgive me for hurrying away, but I daren't stay," she added piteously.
It was closed and fastened with a bolt.
We can get them up for about two dollars and a half apiece.
"There's an end to all things," said Jessica practically, "and really I'm glad to get back into everyday clothes." "Hurry up, slowpokes," said Grace Harlowe, popping her head in the door.
The majority of the girls had gone.
Slipping quietly out of the closet, she approached the back door and cautiously took hold of the bolt.
Grace greeted her cordially and introduced her to her chums, whose simple and unaffected manners soon put her at her ease.
Your father and one of my men left here not five minutes ago.
It had its desired effect, for Edna fairly bristled with indignation and was about to make a furious reply when she was pushed aside by Eleanor, who said loftily, "Allow me to talk to this person, Edna." "No," said Julia resolutely, every vestige of a smile leaving her face at Eleanor's words.
I came here at that time, for I looked at the clock as I came in, but I was only here for a second." Then the truth dawned upon her.
"They're real, downright burglars of the worst sort, and they're planning a robbery.
Edna Wright and the other members of the sorority organized by Eleanor were loud in their expressions of disapproval as to Miss Thompson's "severity" toward Eleanor.
She answered their questions without embarrassment, and seemed quietly pleased at their demonstrations.
"I can't be there," said Anne regretfully.
"I knew she was to blame.
No, I don't mean that.
Hippy ended the tale by marrying the hero to a princess who was a golf fiend and who forced the poor prince to be her caddy.
She arose as they entered and came forward with both hands outstretched.
We have leased a quaint old house in the suburbs called 'Heartsease.' My aunt fell quite in love with it, so perhaps we shall stay awhile.
The orchestra dutifully burst forth with "The Star Spangled Banner," and the effect was indescribable.
"You know the members of this society must stand by each other." "But why did you ask her to join, Grace?" persisted Marian.
Nora won the coveted box of stationery.
When the last girl had disappeared the principal turned to Eleanor.
I want you to promise me that you will do what you can for this motherless girl." "But we felt sure we should like her when we saw her the other day," said Nora.
Is there any one who will encourage me in this laudable resolution, and beguile me while I go 'galumphing' over the ground?" "Oh, I know something that would be perfectly fine!" exclaimed Nora, hopping about in excitement.
Are you hurt, Mabel, dear?" she asked, turning to the young girl, who stood by Jessica, looking white and dazed.
"Talk about your human whirlwinds!
I am entertaining some girls in your class this evening, whom I find far more congenial than any previous acquaintances I have made in Oakdale.
Whenever they asked me I cried and said I didn't know.
"The game is to be called at three o'clock.
I won't keep you another minute, but wait for me outside the campus when school is out to-morrow.
Eleanor, holding the door slightly ajar, peered stealthily out at the new-comer, who was none other than Grace Harlowe.
"Eleanor Savell," she exclaimed sternly.
Southard?" said Miss Tebbs to the actor, who was preparing to leave.
"She looks awfully cross," thought Grace.
Her absence created considerable comment, and it was a matter of speculation as to whether she had purposely absented herself or really had been suspended.
Leaping from the machine with the lost costumes she ran triumphantly into the dressing room.
"I feel it in my bones." "Let's hope that your bones are true prophets," laughed Marian Barber.
"Very well, if I am queen, then I must be obeyed.
I know her name is Savell and that she's a recent arrival in Oakdale, but considering the plain and uncomplimentary manner in which she addressed you, you must have seriously offended her ladyship." "I'll tell you about her as we walk along," replied Grace, wiping her eyes and smiling a little.
With each narrator it grew funnier, until the party screamed with laughter over the misfortunes of the ill-starred prince.
Why, we came out here simply to try to prevent your doing something that might stir up trouble again between the senior and junior classes.
When she heard I was to go with Miss Brant, she kissed me, and gave them to me.
Three fellows of us were initiated to-night.
As they rattled down the street people paused and looked smilingly after them.
She promised to send me to school, and I was wild to get a good education, so I went with her.
"Look at Daisy and Edna.
The final details having been attended to, Miss Tebbs and Miss Kane found time to congratulate each other on the smoothness of the production, which bade fair to surpass anything of the kind ever before given.
I suppose it's the sense of power that one has over people's emotions that makes acting so fascinating.
Mabel looked distressed for a moment then she said, "I wish I might tell you all about it, but I gave my word of honor before I read it that I wouldn't mention the contents to any one." "Then, of course, we won't ask you," said Anne Pierson quickly.
"There's nothing in it but some walnut fudge that I made last night, but I couldn't resist wearing it.
"I never thought about it.
"She is always just," replied Grace.
"We're devoured with curiosity." "'Thereby hangs a tale,'" replied Grace, "but I refuse to be interviewed to-night.
"I care for you, and I'm going to see if I can do something for you.
"I forgot for a moment that you and Eva and Miriam hadn't met her.
CHAPTER XXIII THE JUNIOR PICNIC With the first days of spring, the longing to throw down her books and fairly live in the open returned to Grace Harlowe with renewed force.
Do you think me unpardonably rude?" She looked appealingly at the four chums.
ALTEMUS [Illustration: Grace Snatched Off the White Mask.
"You seem to think yourself the idol of your class, but there are some of the girls who are too clever to be deceived.
"See you later." As she reached the cool shadows of the little strip of woods she drew a long breath.
"The second wagon broke down when about half way home.
"The very thing," she exclaimed.
=The Young Engineers Series= =By H.
As for your Miss Thompson, she is a self-satisfied prig." "You must not say such things of Miss Thompson, Eleanor," said Grace firmly.
I have always believed that your parents were people of means and that you were lost or stolen when a baby.
"It is wonderful to feel that one is able to forget one's self and become some one else.
It was nearing seven o'clock, and she was twelve miles from Oakdale.
5 THE PONY RIDER BOYS IN THE ALKALI; Or, Finding a Key to the Desert Maze.
Just then Miss Tebbs, who had been busy with her list, announced that she would now name the cast, and all conversation ceased as by magic.
It seemed as though the runabout fairly flew over the ground.
The juniors set their teeth and waded in with all their might and main, setting a whirlwind pace that caused their fans to shout with wild enthusiasm and fairly dazed their opponents.
"I'm glad that wasn't David," said Anne as James disappeared.
It fitted her straight, slender figure perfectly and she decided that for once she had been wise in foregoing her favorite blue and choosing red.
Poor little Mabel, no wonder she has a scared look in her eyes all the time." "Well, here we are," responded Mr.
"You must waltz around the room fifteen times without stopping," continued Grace, "and then sit down in the four opposite corners of the room, on the cushions provided for you." The girl chums retreated to the doorway of the room, that had previously been cleared of almost all the furniture, to watch the movements of their victims as they endeavored to circle the room the required number of times.
She dared not answer, as Miss Ames was very strict, and she knew that to be caught whispering meant two originals to work out, and Nora hated originals.
She has been kept in absolute ignorance of him.
"One at a time, girls," laughed Miss Tebbs.
It looks to me as though we had a common enemy.
But Grace, who was well in the lead, caught the last fleeing ghost by its robe and held on for dear life.
You know Hippy never bothered himself much about study, just managed to scrape through.
The juniors had accepted the challenge of the senior class, and had agreed to play them on Saturday, December 12, at two o'clock, in the gymnasium.
"No wonder you were late.
"No," she gasped, "don't call Miss Thompson.
You are going to be happy now, and forget all about this cruel, terrible woman." "You brazen imp, you," screamed the woman, and rushed at Grace, who stood perfectly still, looking the angry woman in the face with such open scorn in her gray eyes that Miss Brant drew back and stood scowling at her, her hands working convulsively.
The principal stood silently regarding them with an expression of severity that was decidedly discomfitting.
4 THE YOUNG ENGINEERS IN MEXICO; Or, Fighting the Mine Swindlers.
"You know perfectly well that none of us will say anything about it.
"It might create bad feeling among the girls.
"Let the music begin," said Grace.
"I am sorry I ever saw it," she continued.
"Now, what does your Majesty crave of her loyal subjects?" inquired Grace, bowing low before the little, old lady.
She said that it was not positively decided yet, but if the girls did well with the mid-year tests, then directly after there would be a try out for parts, and rehearsals would begin without delay." "How splendid!" exclaimed Anne, clasping her hands.
"'Fine and dandy are the Irish,'" said Nora with a grin, quoting from a popular song she had heard in a recent musical comedy.
After stripping the bush, she turned into a bypath that led straight up a little hill which rose before her.
Eleanor had outwardly settled down to the routine of school work in a way that surprised even her aunt.
We shall see," said the judge, rubbing his hands.
Now listen, all ye faithful, while I set forth the object of this walk." She thereupon related what Grace and Anne already knew.
"What I dislike is of more importance to me.
"My name is Grace Harlowe.
After attending the basketball game her aunt had told her rather sharply that if she were able to attend basketball games, she was certainly able to continue her studies.
I just saw a man go around the corner!" The girls looked quickly in the direction of the house.
The rest of us will go in the two automobiles." As they moved toward the door, Grace left them.
Then the sections were rearranged, the seniors taking the seats left by the graduates, and the other classes moving up accordingly.
A breathless silence had fallen over the room.
"It is after eight o'clock and we can't stay out too late, you know." "Very well," said Grace.
"Did you think the examinations hard?" asked Jessica of Eleanor.
She said that she always kept her engagements unless the spirit moved her to do something else." "Is Eleanor Savell the girl who comes into the study hall every morning after opening exercises have begun?" asked Marian Barber.
"Do you?" "No," replied Eleanor a trifle less rudely, "but we have as much right here as you have." "Granted," replied Julia calmly.
You know we promised to meet the boys as soon as school was over." The girl chums walked out of the study hall, each with her mind so full of the new girl, who had so suddenly appeared in their midst, that the proposed call upon Miss Thompson was entirely forgotten.
Still she stubbornly held out, and it was not until the day before the beginning of the new term that she went to her aunt and coldly agreed to comply with her wishes, providing she might have her violin and piano once more.
Here comes the band!" shouted Hippy.
Select your girls, but don't tell them what you want or they may tell some one about it beforehand." "Well, of all impudence!" exclaimed Anne.
We are stars, but we shall refuse to twinkle in your sky unless you suddenly become more respectful." "He doesn't know the definition of the word," said David.
Two vantages scored in succession were needed by one side to win.
1 THE IRON BOYS IN THE MINES; Or, Starting at the Bottom of the Shaft.
Though the sun shone brightly, the air was cool and bracing, and filled one with that vigor and joy of living which makes autumn the most delightful season of the year.
These companies gave daily matinées as well as evening performances, and the more frivolous element of High School girls had in time past occasionally "skipped school" to spend the afternoon in the theatre.
David and Tom Gray quickly raised Mabel to her feet and turned to Grace, whose face was ghastly, while she trembled like a leaf.
I shall stay for pure spite and show that stiff-necked principal of yours that I am a law unto myself, and won't stand her interference." "Stop a moment, Eleanor.
4 GRACE HARLOWE'S SENIOR YEAR AT HIGH SCHOOL; Or, The Parting of the Ways.
Grace and Nora decided to enter the hundred-yard dash.
Such a decision is worse than disobedience--it is lawlessness.
Can she get me again?" she said, turning piteously to Mr.
Southard is shaking hands with her." True enough, Anne was shyly shaking hands with the great actor, who was congratulating her warmly upon her recent effort.
Mabel Allison joined the three girls, who hurried across the stage to the other dressing room in search of Anne Pierson.
The morning passed like magic.
"Oh, I am sure she is all that is delightful," responded Miss Savell, quickly divining that Anne was not pleased at her remark.
This was also seconded and carried.
Ordinarily I would not ask you to betray any of your schoolmates, but in this instance I am justified, and you are making a serious mistake in sacrificing your duty upon the altar of school-girl honor." "I am sorry, Miss Thompson," said Grace, striving to steady her voice.
"But I am not in line for congratulations, as I was not in the play." "I am very sorry that you could not play Orlando to-night.
I came to ask permission to use the gymnasium, but you were out, so I came back and asked you just before school closed." "Yes, I remember that you did," replied the principal.
I am not going to any extreme measures to find the miscreant.
He says Jessica won't look at him any more." "Reddy is laboring under a false impression," said Anne.
That is the reason she brought her to Oakdale." "Hurry up, you two," called Nora, who had reached the steps.
The girls were requested to pay fifty cents apiece to the treasurer.
Gray's, but whatever you do will suit me." "Awfully sorry, Anne," said Grace.
"There can be no formation of classes to-day, as the bulletins of the various subjects have just been posted, and will undoubtedly undergo some changes.
She wished it to be a class among classes, and felt an almost motherly anxiety for its success.
"We all have supper at half past six and must save our appetites for that." "We usually dine about eight o'clock," said Eleanor.
Besides, Guido Savelli was thoroughly selfish at heart.
Be careful they don't play you a trick." The two girls cautiously approached the door, opening it very slowly, and saw--not the three boys--but Eleanor.
Scrambling up the hill, Grace reached the top and looked about her.
Even the boys like Miss Thompson." "It was an effectual threat at any rate," said Jessica.
"How dare you speak to us in that manner and treat us as though we were children?" she burst forth.
"I suppose we could all squeeze into David's automobile." "I believe we'd better not," replied Grace.
Then her face cleared and she said softly: "My dear Christmas children, I am very anxious that for her own sake you should become well acquainted with Eleanor.
Southard, kindly consented to come from Albany for the sole purpose of giving us the benefit of his great Shakespearian experience.
Gray, very well." "Oh, do you know her?" replied Eleanor lightly.
After an instant's hesitation, she was followed by Edna, Daisy Culver and those who had come with her.
I'm so glad," Grace said softly to Nora and Jessica.
By a quarter of two the gallery was fairly well filled and by five minutes of two it was crowded.
Grace, you help Anne, and Jessica and Mabel and I will run across and look for them." With these words, Nora was off, the other two girls at her heels.
Down one page she read and half way through the next before Mr.
He and David are waiting outside with their cars.
It is their ambition to become loud and loyal fans." "What a worthy ambition," said Marian Barber, with a giggle.
Jessica ably demonstrated her ability to outhop her competitors, while Eva Allen covered herself with glory in the apple contest.
It was nearly eleven by the city hall clock when she hurried up the steps of the police station.
We'll have to about face if we expect to get home before dark." So the start back was made, but their progress was slow.

"Before I tell you what is on my mind," said Grace, "we ought to have a president, vice president and secretary for this worthy organization.
She still smarted a little at Eleanor's rude reply to her invitation.
"Anyone can twist 'Annabel Lee' to suit the occasion." "By the way, Anne," said Grace, "as you are a poet, you must compose a basketball song to-day, and I'll see that the juniors all have copies.
There was one woman at the orphanage who was always good to me.
Try her, and if you like her, then she is welcome to stay as long as she chooses.

You may take your own seat," said the principal.
CHAPTER XV A WOULD-BE "LARK" Eleanor Savell and the seven girls who formed their sorority were the first to enter the study hall on Tuesday morning.
"But let me tell you I should have been in hysterics if I had been left alone in the dark twelve miles from nowhere." Judge Putnam did not at once make his plan known to Grace.
"However, there is this difference.
"Well, what do you want?" she said rudely.
"We have come for you." "May I speak with Miss Brant?" asked Mr.
They are nice and round and hard, and will hit the stage with a resounding whack, providing he can throw straight enough to hit anything.
Her aunt tells me she is a remarkable performer on both violin and piano." "But why shouldn't she go to her father if he is a great musician?" said Jessica.
I thought you would be awfully interested in her.
"Maybe she has seen the paper.
You haven't the slightest claim upon her, and she is perfectly free to do as she chooses.
Her voice sounded unusually clear and sweet, yet lacked something of the power of expression displayed by Grace in her rendering of the same scene.
"The first thing to be thought of is the play itself.
I thank you," said Grace, with a curtsy.
4 THE BATTLESHIP BOYS IN THE TROPICS; Or, Upholding the American Flag in a Honduras Revolution.
Anne's work had seemed to grow finer with every rehearsal.
We have before us two matters that need attention.
After addressing the chair, Grace began: "I know you will all be glad to hear that Mabel has received a letter from Mary Stevens.
They were three shy, quiet girls who had worshiped Grace from a distance, and who had been surprised almost to tears by her invitation.
If you girls will excuse me, I'll hunt them up." "Certainly," said the girls.
The realization of what some of these girls were willing to endure for the sake of getting an education made Grace feel guilty at being so comfortably situated.
I'll ask my mother to-morrow, and you girls might do the same." "Miriam Nesbit, what a perfectly lovely plan!" exclaimed Grace Harlowe with rapture.
Jessica was in raptures over "Phebe," while Nora had captured "Touchstone," Eva Allen, "Audrey," and, to her great delight, Grace was told that she was to play "Orlando," with Eleanor as "Celia." The other parts were assigned among the sophomores and freshmen who had made the best showing, Mabel Allison getting the part of Jaques.
CHAPTER XIX THE TRY OUT "Will the young lady on the extreme right please come forward?" said Mr.
Reddy, who was playing left end on the home team, received an ovation every time he made a move, and when towards the end of the game he made a touchdown, his friends nearly split their loyal throats in expressing their approval.
"But, to give the play a rest and come down to everyday affairs, where shall we meet to go to the football game?" "Let me see," said Grace.
"Girls," said Grace earnestly, "don't you think our society has been a success so far?" "Yes, indeed," was the united answer.
There isn't anything remarkable about me.
As she neared it she noticed that the door was wide open.
IRVING HANCOCK= The keynote of these books is manliness.
"She can live at our house forever, if she doesn't disturb me," replied Eleanor lazily.
Grace felt ready to cry, then the vision of the poor old judge, alone and at the mercy of the two ruffians, flashed before her.
She jerked her hat and coat from her locker, hastily donned them, and, without looking at Grace, left the room.
"There ain't a soul on the joint except the judge and one old servant," growled Bill.
I had no business to let all the servants except old James go for the night.

Therefore I decided to take a hand in things, and here I am, backed by girls from both classes, who are of the self-same mind." "Really, Miss Crosby," said Edna Wright, "you are very amusing." "My friends all think so," returned Julia sweetly, "but never mind now about my amusing qualities, Edna.
Then let's go to-morrow and bring Mabel back with us." "Very well; you and Jessica meet me at my office at four o'clock to-morrow afternoon," said Mr.
"Miss Bright and Miss O'Malley, who were in the second wagon, thought you were in the first with Miss Pierson and Miss Nesbit, and vice versa," replied the chief.
"I have," said Grace, with a slight shudder.
Then I hear a strange whistle, many times, and I think some one get lost and I cry 'hello,' and you answer and I find mademoiselle and her friends." "That was the Elf's Horn, Jean," replied Tom, "and you heard because you are a hunter." "I know not what monsieur mean by Elf Horn, but I hear whistle, anyhow, and come," remarked the old man, smiling.
I really didn't feel like going to school to-day, so I stayed in bed until eleven o'clock.
"I'll go at once and get a gown for Anne.
There were miniature ears of corn, turkeys, pumpkins and various other favors appropriate to Thanksgiving at each one's place.
Well, the minute she heard it she went back there like a flash, looking for all the world like a thunder cloud.
"I need Mabel more than do the rest of you, but perhaps if you're good I'll loan her to you occasionally.
I am not very strong, you know." "Hear him," jeered Reddy.

"Well, you just take her, if you dare." "Have you legally adopted her?" asked Mr.
Every eye was fixed on the actor, who stood with a small leather-covered edition of "As You Like It" in his hand.
Each girl seemed bent on distinguishing herself, and that teacher was heard laughingly to declare that she had an "all star cast." In spite of rehearsals, Grace Harlowe's team found time for a few basketball games, and whipped the senior team twice in succession, much to the disgust of Captain Julia Crosby, who threatened to go into deep mourning over what she called "her dead and gone team." She even composed a mournful ditty, which she sang in their ears in a wailing minor key whenever she passed any of them, and practically tormented them, until they actually did win one hard-fought victory over the juniors, "just to keep Julia from perpetrating her eternal chant," as one of them remarked.
There isn't a girl here who would be so contemptible as to tell any one outside about what has happened to-day." This was Eleanor's opportunity.
It almost grazed her outstretched hand, then shot on down the road without slackening its speed for an instant.
She insists on having Anne with her on Thanksgiving, although Anne had invited two girls to her house," continued Grace.
Won't you come back to the Phi Sigma Tau?
It is called the Elf's Horn." "Did you ever try it before," asked Reddy curiously.
Gray go on with her story." "When the baby sister, whose name was Edith, was about three years old, the beautiful young mother died and left the husband inconsolable.
Her hair was jet black and lay on her forehead in little silky rings, while she had the bluest eyes the girls had ever seen.
"Here she is." The runabout had stopped and Eleanor alighted.
I don't think Miss Savell intended me to see it.
I hope that when I next hear from you, you will be in happier surroundings.
You seem determined to meddle with matters that do not concern you, and I warn you that if you do not change your tactics you may regret it.
I am sorry that you have such a poor opinion of myself and my friends, for we cherish nothing but the friendliest feelings toward you." With this, Grace walked away, feeling more hurt over Eleanor's rudeness than she cared to show.
"The reason we are interested is because we know the owner of the property, Mrs.
After the holidays came the brief period of hard study before the dreaded mid-year examinations.
"Here's the wonderful paper that Miss Tabby Cat Thompson is going to read before the 'Arts and Crafts Club' to-morrow," she murmured.
"I'll have a private interview with him to-morrow and that will insure his good behavior." "Thank you, angel Nora," replied Hippy gratefully.
They have lived in France, Germany, Italy and Spain, with an occasional visit to America, and Eleanor has always done just as she pleased.
"Why, I don't see her here," cried Grace, making a quick survey of the room.
"Beyond a doubt you would make a beautiful Rosalind; but I am convinced that no other girl can enact the part with the spirit and dash that Miss Pierson can.
The Square Dollar Boys Series =By H.
Then Julia Crosby scored on a field goal, making the score 3 to 2.
"Go on with what you were saying, Miriam." But before Miriam had a chance to continue, the maid entered the room, a letter in her hand.
Grace knew that the principal was still displeased with her.
"I hate you, Grace Harlowe, fifty times more than ever before," she said, her voice shaking with anger.
The date for the affair was set for the following Saturday, the weather permitting, and it was generally agreed that Forest Park, a natural park about twelve miles from Oakdale, would be an ideal place to picnic.
How delightful it was to hear the rustle of the leaves over her head, and tread upon Nature's green carpet of soft, thick moss.
"That Edna Wright told me, that I needn't think we were the only people that could have a sorority.
The Range and Grange Hustlers =By FRANK GEE PATCHIN= Have you any idea of the excitements, the glories of life on great ranches in the West?
Don't put your irreverent hands on him," was David's injunction.
"I don't believe Miss Thompson would ever suspect us of any such thing," remarked Jessica to her friends.
"If you are ready, suppose we go.
The lunch had been divided into four packages and each boy strapped a package to his shoulder.
"Follow me." She led the way to the dining room, where a bountiful lunch awaited them, to which, after the manner of hungry school girls, they did full justice.
I think I understand how you feel, and I hope you get the best part in the play.
Grace laughed in spite of herself at Nora's remark, but regretted it the next moment, for Eleanor saw the glances directed toward her and heard Nora's giggle.
Finally they all grew so hungry they sat down and disposed of the remaining food.
"I realize I've had a narrow escape," he exclaimed to the chief the next day.
"You inspired me." Eleanor accompanied the four girls down the walk to the gate and repeatedly invited them to come again.
Nora and Jessica looked their silent sympathy, but Grace stood apparently wrapped in thought.
"She said such dreadful things." "No one who knows you would believe them," replied Julia.
Promise me you won't." "I never make rash promises," answered David, smiling.
Please don't refuse me, Miss Tebbs, but let me go.
Battleship Boys Series =By FRANK GEE PATCHIN= These stories throb with the life of young Americans on to-day's huge drab Dreadnaughts.
It would be advisable, however, to arrange as speedily as possible about the subjects you intend to take, as we wish to begin recitations by Friday at the latest, and I dare say the changes made in the schedule will be slight." Then the work of assigning each class to its particular section of the study hall began.
After deliberately setting their stage in full view of the audience at one end of the room, the play began, with David as the meek, hen-pecked husband, Hippy as the neglected child, who wept and howled continuously, while Reddy played the unnatural wife and mother, who neglected her family and held woman's suffrage meetings in the street.
I am going no farther with you," said Grace, flushing, "but I should just like to say before I leave you that you are taking the wrong view of things, and you'll find it out sooner or later.
He lost flesh at an alarming rate, and three months after his wedding day they laid him to rest in the quiet churchyard, with the touching epitaph over him, 'Things are not what they seem.'" Hippy buried his face in his handkerchief and sobbed audibly until David and Reddy pounced upon him and he was obliged to forego his lamentations and defend himself.
"I've only been ten minutes on the way," she breathed as she neared her destination.
Miss Tebbs, teacher of elocution; Miss Kane, teacher of gymnastics, and Miss Thompson stood at one side of the library talking earnestly as they noted each newcomer.
Gray's would scarcely keep me away long enough to miss my first entrance.
At the last minute, however, Edna pleaded a severe headache and recommended Eleanor in her place.
Cloth, Illustrated Price, per Volume, 50c.
Did Miss Thompson say that you would have to take examinations?" "She did, she did," answered Eleanor ruefully.
She stumbled frequently as she neared her journey's end, and her tired body cried out for rest, but she pushed resolutely on, almost sobbing with relief as she entered the suburbs of the town.
I shall be sixteen next month, and exempt from the school law.
"Let's not stand here discussing you all night.
That would give her some money for clothes for next year.
The girls surrounded it in an instant.
I read it in the paper last night.
"It wouldn't fly worth a cent to-day.
"As long as I was the first to agree to look out for Eleanor, I have decided I had better be with you at the finish," said Grace, as the two girls walked slowly up the drive.
Perhaps by that time we could find some nice people for her to stay with, or if we liked her well enough, we could go on having her with us.
After the usual preliminaries, the game began, and for the next hour everything else was forgotten save the battle that waged between the two teams.
She could not feel sorry at Eleanor's recent agitation.
"Really and truly, Nora, the more you travel with Hippy, the more you talk like him," remarked Grace.
She and her satellites are sitting away up on the back seat of the gallery." "Where?" asked Nora, going to the door.
She drilled me thoroughly in English and mathematics.
She opened it last night after we left.
3 THE MOTOR BOAT CLUB OFF LONG ISLAND; Or, A Daring Marine Game at Racing Speed.
"By the way, who is she?
"I wrote it because I wished to.
I'll have to hurry now, or miss my appointment." Mr.
"I am fully convinced that you have hidden Anne's costumes and I am equally certain that you are going to produce them at once." "Then you are laboring under a delusion," replied Eleanor, with a disagreeable laugh, "and I should advise you to devote that tireless energy of yours, to minding your own business." "This is my business," replied Grace evenly, "and if you wish to avoid any unpleasantness you will make it yours." "Your threats do not alarm me," sneered Eleanor.
Anne knows, but, you see, it particularly concerned her.
It is doubly provoking, because Mr.
Look out for Hippy!" she cried, then hurried to catch up with the others.
1 GRACE HARLOWE'S PLEBE YEAR AT HIGH SCHOOL; Or, The Merry Doings of the Oakdale Freshman Girls.
His brilliant playing had already created a sensation wherever he appeared, and he gave promise of being a virtuoso.
"Here it is: 'I am so sorry about the way in which you are treated, but glad to know that you have found friends at last.
I think having him here will be a lark.
You see, your rescue party proved a success.
"Only don't rush me over the ground so fast.
Jessica and Nora had both begun to cry, while the faces of the others fully expressed their feelings.
You know Chapel Hill is quite a distance from my house." "I should say so," replied Grace.
If it doesn't concern us we don't care, do we, girls?" "No, indeed," was the reply.
4 THE CIRCUS BOYS ON THE MISSISSIPPI; Or, Afloat with the Big Show on the Big River.
"Only," she concluded with a shame-faced air, "there are times when the desire to act is irresistible, and it did make my heart beat a little bit faster when I heard about the play." "You dear little mouse," said Grace, putting her arm around Anne.
At recess there was more grouping and whispering, and Grace was puzzled and not a little hurt over the way in which she and her friends were ignored.

My aunt has spoiled me, and I frankly admit it.

Just wait until I get near enough to tell him that you mistook him for a lunatic.
On her way to rhetoric recitation, she stopped at Professor La Roche's door, greatly astonishing him by a prettily worded apology, which he readily accepted and beamed upon her with forgiving good-nature.
Grace and Jessica exerted every effort to quiet her sobs, and after a little she looked up, and, smiling through her tears, said brokenly: "I can't believe that it's all true--that I shall never have to go back there again.
She is frivolous and empty-headed, and Eleanor is self-willed and lawless.
Even Grace, who was conducting the ceremony with the utmost seriousness, laughed a little at the picture they made.
Such a thing had not happened since the basketball trouble the previous year.
I loathed them both, but studied them merely to show her that I could master them.
And now I wish to say that I despise you and all your friends, and wish never to speak to any of you again.
Come on, Mabel, let's go home before they spoil you completely." "Considering the fact that the Bright family did two thirds of the rescuing, I suppose we shall have to respect your claim," said Nora, "but remember, Jessica, that generosity is a beautiful virtue to cultivate." CHAPTER X JULIA PERFORMS A SACRED DUTY "What have we ever done that we should be so neglected?" said David Nesbit, swinging himself from his motorcycle and landing squarely in front of Grace Harlowe and Anne Pierson while they were out walking one afternoon.
Be straightforward and honorable in all your dealings, girls; so that when the day comes for you to receive your diplomas and bid Oakdale High School farewell, you can do so with the proud consciousness that you have been to your schoolmates just what you would have wished them to be to you.
Look at this poor, little Allison girl.
I look to you girls to keep her out of mischief." "Well, we'll try, but I never did pride myself on being a first-class reformer," said Grace, laughing.
"That will do," she said curtly, after they had stood for what seemed to them an age, but was really only a couple of minutes.
"I am glad I brought you girls along to protect me." "You haven't any idea what a crank she is, Mr.
Besides, where would she go if we did get her away?" "I'll tell you what I'll do," said Jessica thoughtfully.
"Haven't you any relatives at all, Miss Allison, or any one else with whom you could stay?" Mabel shook her head.
"Aunt Rose was telling me about her this morning at breakfast.
"That's the reason I asked Grace to appoint a committee of juniors and come out here with me.
It was addressed to me on the outside envelope and Mabel has given me permission to open and read it to you.
ELEANOR THROWS DOWN THE GAUNTLET 85 IX.
But to get down to the business of the hour--tell me, Mabel, dear--did this Miss Brant legally adopt you when she took you from the orphanage, or are you bound to her in any way?" "I don't know," said the girl, her eyes growing big with wonder.
"Oh, look!" whispered Jessica, clutching Nora's arm.
We didn't ask any of the girls about them, because if we couldn't find them we feel sure the others couldn't.
"If you've come here to quiz me and pry around about her, you can get right out, for I'm not answering any fool questions." "I will not trouble you with further questions," replied Mr.
As to the other two girls, they are sworn friends of Edna's." "I think," said Nora, "that our reform movement is about to end in a glaring fizzle." "How can we reform a person who won't have anything to do with us?" asked Jessica scornfully.
Tell us how she looks." "She is tall," replied Anne, "and has beautiful dark eyes.
"She acts as though she'd known us all her life, and we never set eyes on her until she marched in and calmly interrupted us ten minutes ago." "It doesn't seem to make much difference whether or not we like her.
However, the really great ones are few and far between.
Who knows?" "Hello-o-o!" cried a voice seemingly close by.
"If I were you, James, I'd take off that costume and hurry away.
Gray, please pardon me for interrupting you, I was so excited that I didn't realize my own rudeness." "Granted, my dear," smiled the old lady.
But who is the reckless young person playing chauffeur?
"No, Eleanor is better off with her aunt.
"By the way, girls, do you think it would be of any use to invite Eleanor?" "Eleanor?" exclaimed Nora.
They almost grovel before her." "Never mind, Nora," said Grace.
In spite of her recent assertion that she could not forgive Eleanor, Grace's resentment vanished at sight of her enemy's humiliation.
Before they could do any damage they were apprehended and a bag containing a complete outfit of burglar's tools was taken away from them.
Before going upstairs to dress, she ran into the reception hall for the fourth time to feast her eyes upon a huge bunch of tall chrysanthemums in the beautiful Japanese vase that stood in the alcove under the stairs.
It was remarkable that things ever straightened themselves.
Then a certain young man who is waiting outside for her will be sure to recognize her.
Then she suddenly clasped her hands.
He's here for the try-out!" "Why of course he is," exclaimed Grace.
"If we find that this is not enough, we will levy another tax," Grace announced.
They'll be very much astonished to find us 'waiting at the church'--Omnibus House, I mean," said Julia, "and I imagine they'll feel rather silly, too." "Tell us who they are, Julia," said Grace.
Have you a latch key?
Now run along with Jessica and forget all about what has passed.
Eleanor Savell will again seek revenge, and Grace Harlowe will once more prove herself equal to the occasion.
But I don't know whether I should like Wellesley.
At last she had found a way to effectually annoy the principal.
By the way, where does the affair take place?" he added, trying to look innocent.
When we lived in Spain she used to help every beggar we came across, and Spain is a land of beggars.
During the dinner Eleanor was not again mentioned, although she occupied more or less of the four girls' thoughts.
Gray, Judge," said Grace, "always imagining yourself old, when you know you're just a great big boy." "Very pretty, my dear," chuckled the judge.
Really, girls, it is hard to believe that Miriam Nesbit and Julia Crosby were at one time the banes of our existence.
Come on, girls," she said, turning to the members of her party, who had listened in silent amazement to her attack upon Grace.
Then she turned impulsively toward Grace and said: "Yes; I will tell you, although no one can help me.
"Do you know, girls," said Grace, as they left the gymnasium that afternoon, "I am sorry that Eleanor won't be peaceable.
She is one of the finest women I have ever known, and she takes a warm interest in every girl in school.
I don't----" She stopped short, an expression of terror overspreading her good-natured face, as she mutely pointed toward the old house.
"I have forgiven, long ago, but I have not forgotten the way some of those girls performed last year.
Gray, and you all know it." "The best thing to do," said Anne, smiling a little, "is to tell Mrs.
Then his quick eye traveled to Grace's fine face and graceful figure, and then on to Anne, whose small face was alive with the excitement of the moment.
Nora began and read glibly on, unconsciously emphasizing as she did so.
She was almost across the square when her ear caught the sound of a low sob.
"You have almost missed hearing one of my best girls.
"We didn't wait to ask her to-day." "I shall have to confess that I am the guilty one," said Eva Allen.
"Perhaps we'd better let the old hatchet alone," Daisy Culver said sullenly.
Grace and her friends were among the first to leave, and hurried to the street, where the boys awaited them.
2 DICK PRESCOTT'S SECOND YEAR AT WEST POINT; Or, Finding the Glory of the Soldier's Life.
"I hate school," she said vehemently.
Some one is over at the old house.
It is the other side that I hate," she added, with a slight shudder.
She had done very well and Miss Tebbs had praised her work, though in her secret heart Eleanor knew that Anne's work was finer than her own.
"ELEANOR SAVELL." "Well, of all things!" exclaimed Marian Barber.
"It will seem good to have a frolic with the boys again, won't it?" said Grace to Anne as they strolled along.
Can I do anything to help you?" Then Grace gave a little surprised exclamation.
"They'll have to work to catch up with us now," said Nora O'Malley triumphantly to the members of the team, who sat resting in the little side room off the gymnasium.
"Something has come to my ears, girls," said the principal, "that I find hard to credit, but before you leave here this afternoon I must know who is innocent and who is guilty." Miss Thompson paused and a number of girls stirred uneasily in their seats, while a few glanced quickly toward Eleanor, who was looking straight ahead, the picture of innocence.
Shouting the war cry of the juniors." There was a great clapping of hands from the admirers of the juniors at this effort, but the seniors promptly responded from the other end of the gallery to the tune of Dixie, with: "The seniors are the real thing.
No one had ever before dared to speak sharply to her.
"How you do lag to-day." "You will hear more of this later," whispered Anne.
It is really a shame for her to be so unreasonable." "Grace Harlowe, are you ever going to stop mourning over Eleanor?" cried Miriam impatiently.
She never can resist an appeal for charity." There was a sudden silence.
They are all tale-bearers and sneaks." With these words, Eleanor angrily flung the book she held on the desk and walked down the aisle toward the door, but Miss Thompson barred her way.
You need it after a twelve-mile walk.
"Hippy says awfully funny things." "Look at our little Anne," said Jessica.
"That's none of your business, either.
All that remained to be done was to tell her three friends, and consult them as to what other four girls would be eligible to membership.
To her joy it moved easily.
The lawn looked like a great stretch of green velvet, while the trees were gorgeous in their autumn glory of crimson and gold, with here and there a patch of russet by way of contrast.
Miss Tebbs has asked him to run up here and pick out the cast." "Good gracious," said Jessica.
Now that they were fairly started on their mission of rescue, they were not quite so confident as to the result.
Anne stood perfectly still, looking rather dazed.
"You're not a day older at heart than any of the rest of us.
Songs, speeches and recitations followed rapidly until everyone had contributed something in the way of a stunt.
"Some one to see papa," said Jessica.
"I suppose a sorority is about to come to the surface.
"Now that we have that question settled," said Miriam Nesbit, after the girls were once more seated, "I think we ought to have a sorority pin." "I think," began Eva Allen, "that my brother would design a pin for us.
"I shall retire in confusion if he looks at me.
Grace made a handsome Orlando, while Jessica looked an ideal shepherdess.
She hurried down to the locker-room that afternoon in order to catch Eleanor as she left school.

M.= These breezy stories of the American High School Girl take the reader fairly by storm.
Saturday, December 12, dawned cold and clear, and the girls on both teams were in high spirits as they hustled into their respective locker-rooms and rapidly donned their gymnasium suits.
This was the last stunt." "Well, I suppose under those circumstances we shall have to forgive you.
"That oath has a rather familiar sound," remarked Miriam Nesbit, trying to recollect where she had heard it before.
"She will hear from Miss Thompson if she makes a practice of staying out of school.
Out she rushed and collided with a girl who was about to enter.
"She has gone out of her way to be nice to girls that she used to snub unmercifully.
She feels that you made too great a sacrifice for her in giving up your part." "Nonsense," said Grace.
Boys will alternately thrill and chuckle when reading these splendid narratives.
Just then a figure appeared, stared at the approaching girls and began waving his hat wildly, at the same time doing a sort of war dance.
"I was thinking about a walk to the old Omnibus House." "'Great minds run in the same channel,'" quoted Jessica.
She was no longer on the old terms of intimacy with Miss Thompson.
She is still there, and several times she has written to me, but Miss Brant read her letters first and then tore them up.
I ran almost all the way up there.
"She really seems to be sincere." "She's too sincere for comfort," murmured Anne, who hated compliments.
"Very well, Grace, have your own way," replied the teacher reluctantly.
We want to avoid all eleventh-hour scrambling and exciting costume hunts." Laughing merrily, the girls began choosing places to hang their costumes in the big room off the stage where they were to dress.
"We still have a mile to go before we are through the wood.
After the seniors had quietly left the study hall, Miss Thompson stood gravely regarding the rows of girls before her.
Gray, enthroned in a big chair in one corner of the drawing room, was in her element, and the young folks vied with each other in doing her homage.
They've begun to dig, and they are having their own troubles, for the ground is hard.
She had decided in her own mind that Rosalind was the part best suited to her, and felt that the honor now lay between herself and Grace.
I am not angry, even if she is; although I have far greater cause to be." But before the close of the week Grace was destined to cross swords with Eleanor in earnest, and the toleration she had felt was swallowed up in righteous indignation.
You get out of my house or I'll throw you out and these two snips of girls with you," almost screamed Miss Brant.
"Lots of people know of it," remarked Eva Allen.
"She's not that sort." "We shall see.
In the center of one table stood two dolls dressed in the style of costume worn by the Pilgrim fathers and mothers.
Each of you is to have two and Jessica has one besides Mabel.
"That man is Everett Southard, the great Shakespearian actor," said Anne almost reverently.
In this manner she idled the days away until the holiday vacation came, congratulating herself upon her success in pulling wool over the eyes of her long-suffering aunt.
Besides, Miss Pierson is too short.
They tossed their heads, but they didn't hiss any more." "What did Ruth say to them?" asked Grace curiously.
I'm awfully glad to know you, and feel honored at being a member of your sorority.
The father had been a rich man, so they had no anxiety about money, and lived on year after year in their beautiful old home, with everything heart could wish.
Will you help me with my costume and make-up?
A refreshment committee was appointed, also a transportation committee.
"I love those two rooms." "You will find them somewhat changed," remarked Eleanor as she opened the door and ushered the girls into the most quietly luxurious apartment they had ever seen.
March!" called Grace, and the eight girls solemnly proceeded to the initiation chamber.
Gray has a double motive in asking us up here to-day.
2 BEN LIGHTBODY'S BIGGEST PUZZLE; Or, Running the Double Ghost to Earth.
"Very well done," commended Grace.
"I had an English governess who was with us for five years.
You know, she was graduated from High School last June and she could help me a lot in getting used to college.
"Now I'm in for it," groaned Grace.
I was dying to cross swords with that old stone face." Then everyone talked at once, surrounding Mabel and asking her questions until Grace said, laughing: "Stop it, girls; let her get used to you gradually.
IRVING HANCOCK= The principal characters in these narratives are manly, young Americans whose doings will inspire all boy readers.
Gray knew my aunt years ago.
"Grace Harlowe, if you ever attempt to conciliate her again, I'll disown you." "What does she mean by saying that we discussed her affairs with Mrs.
"I suppose it did look as though I told you girls," said Mabel Allison, who had joined them at the gate.
"Do you know that man?" "No," replied Anne, "but I know who he is." "He must be a remarkable person, considering the way you gasped and clutched me," laughed Grace.
"It is so terribly still back there among those pines.
Drawing a note from it, she silently handed it to Grace, who read: "MY DEAR ANNE: "Will you come up to my house before going to the hall?
"I don't know where I shall go after I finish High School," said Grace.
I can't bother to ring after I get there." "I'll go and get my key," said Eleanor, wiping her eyes.
Suppose you and Jessica and I go down there together, Grace, and see what we can do?" "O Mr.
THE CLAIM OF THE "ARTISTIC TEMPERAMENT" 78 VIII.
We won't have many more chances, either, for winter will be upon us before we know it.
3 THE SUBMARINE BOYS AND THE MIDDIES; Or, The Prize Detail at Annapolis.
I suppose she's over in the other dressing room.
It would do no harm and it might possibly do some good.
I suppose you don't know where I live or anything about me, do you?" "No," replied Grace, shaking her head, "but I'd be glad to have you tell me." "Well," continued Mabel, "I'm an orphan, and I live with Miss Brant.
We could at least have gotten along peaceably with her.
Eleanor's apology was not due, however, to a change of heart.
CHAPTER XIV ELEANOR FINDS A WAY Now that Thanksgiving was past, basketball became the topic of the hour.
Bright." "I'll go for him at once," said Jessica, and darted off to the library, where her father sat reading.
Grace was in her element and gave a sigh of regret as they sighted the park.
Grace, who knew the scene by heart, went fearlessly forward, and read the lines with splendid emphasis.
"I regret that I'm too busy to bow my thanks.
Minute after minute went by, but the intruders showed no signs of leaving.
A direct slap in the face could scarcely have conveyed greater insult than did that one insolent glance.
I suppose that's why it seems so unendurable to me now." "David Nesbit didn't disturb us, after all," remarked Eva Allen.
"Your father will do all the talking.
"How dare she touch you?
They all decided on solid geometry and English reading, as they could be together for these classes, but the rest was not so easy, for Nora, who loathed history, was obliged to take ancient history to complete her history group, the other girls having wisely completed theirs the previous year.
Eleanor stood at one end of the great room, with Edna Wright and Daisy Culver.
I am very sorry I came back at all." Turning on her heel, she walked back to the runabout, climbed in and drove down the road like the wind, apparently indifferent as to what comment her heartless behavior might create.
Everett Southard." He was greeted with a round of applause, and after bowing his thanks, the eminent actor plunged at once into the business at hand.
As for you," turning to Miss Brant, "if you try to stop her, you will soon find yourself in a most unpleasant position.
We travel most of the time, and I get very tired of it," she concluded with a little pout.
The object of her search was not there.
"What are you two mooning over?" asked a gay voice, and the two girls turned with a start to find Julia Crosby grinning cheerfully at them.
"If you girls carry this hatchet to school and exhibit it to the seniors on the day of the game you are apt to start bad feeling all over again," she said, turning to the others.
I feel sure that she must be the right sort of girl, or you and your friends wouldn't have become interested in her.
CHAPTER XXIV CONCLUSION The special policemen sent out to the Putnam estate were not doomed to disappointment.
In every sense they belong to the best class of books for boys and girls.
"Save your caustic comments," said Grace as she handed Jessica her hat.
The girls did dissect crabs and lobsters, and even rabbits, last year, but they were dead long before they ever reached the zoölogy class." "Oh," said Jessica, somewhat reassured, "I'm glad to hear that, at any rate." "That makes three subjects," said Nora.
She told me to come here and look over the list of subjects.
That is partly my reason for inviting you here this afternoon, although you know you are welcome whenever you choose to come." "Is it a fairy story, dear Mrs.
Nora and Anne, with their charges, came next, and last of all David, Tom and Hippy paraded up the walk, in single file, blowing lustily on tin horns and waving blue and white banners.
Who did you say brought the news?
The other girls expressed their disapproval in equally frank terms.
"After what she has said to you!
"Isn't she a dainty, little, old creature?
It looks like a deliberate attempt to insult me.
"He's the idol of the hour.
I thought no one outside knew the name of our society as yet," said Jessica as she opened the end of the envelope.
I am surprised that she even allows you to go to school." "That's just the trouble," the girl replied, her voice husky.
"I hope to know her better." "You are lucky to get 'Heartsease,'" said Grace.
I should advise you to drive more carefully in future, or you may not escape so easily another time." Eleanor flushed at these words and said haughtily, "I did not ask for advice, I asked for information." "Very true," replied Miriam calmly, "but you see I have given you both." "You are the most ill-bred lot of girls I have ever seen," returned Eleanor crossly, "and I think you are making a great deal of unnecessary fuss over a small matter.
"I was rather surprised, too.
We've had so many special meetings." "I know it," replied Grace, "but after Thanksgiving we'll only meet once in two weeks, for I must get my basketball team in shape, and you see all the members belong to the society." "You ought to do extra good work this year," observed Anne, "for the team is absolutely harmonious.
"Can you manage the machine?" faltered Eleanor.
She could not forgive Eleanor for having accused her and her friends of carrying tales before almost the entire school; therefore a forced apology would not appease her wounded pride.
One of the things that our sorority has pledged itself to do this year is to look up the stray girls in High School, and see that they are not lonely and homesick during holiday seasons.
I'll give you five minutes, but if----" "I'll be back in that time," cried Grace, and was gone, leaving Miss Tebbs and the three chums mystified but faintly hopeful.
Then the story of their escape had to be gone over again for Arnold's benefit.
"'Yours sincerely, "'ELEANOR SAVELL.'" "Well, of all things!" exclaimed Nora O'Malley.
Miriam Nesbit was intrusted with the "Duke," while Marian Barber was to play "Frederick," his brother.
2 THE MEADOW-BROOK GIRLS ACROSS COUNTRY; Or, The Young Pathfinders on a Summer Hike.
"Run along and put on male attire.
I'd better put them on.
She is to be your companion in misery." Eleanor laughed, shook hands with the others and graciously allowed Nora to tie a handkerchief over her eyes.
"How well you play!" exclaimed Jessica with eager admiration in her voice, as Eleanor turned around on the stool after she had finished.
So the circle was enlarged to ten young people, who managed to crowd the two weeks' vacation with all sorts of healthful pleasures.
1 THE PONY RIDER BOYS IN THE ROCKIES; Or, The Secret of the Lost Claim.
It took over half an hour to get it fixed, so when it did arrive the girls in the head wagon had all gone home.
Were I to question each girl in turn I fear the offender might perjure herself rather than admit her guilt.
"Your silence indicates that you are still insubordinate.
"This way," answered the voice, and a light flashed a little distance off, revealing to them a man waving a lantern with one hand and beckoning with the other.
It will be the greatest lark ever," cried Grace.
You can't adopt her, you know." "She is to take turns living with us, papa," said Jessica, slipping her hand into her father's.
Gray's coachman would drive me out, but those horses are so slow.
"How well Miss Thompson looks," whispered Grace to Anne as they neared their seats.
They could not believe that this was the capricious Eleanor of half an hour before.
Glancing about to see that no one was near, she was about to step into the corridor when she heard the sound of approaching footsteps.
If it can be found before the second act, all will be well, but suppose you go on in the first act, and it can't be found, what then?
"I merely stated that there are times when I feel the pangs of hunger." "Stop squabbling," said Jessica, "and let's lay some plans." "Where shall we lay them?" innocently asked Hippy.
Like a flash she gathered up a pile of costumes marked "Rosalind," covered them with her long fur coat and ran through the hall and down the steps to where her runabout was stationed.
The Phi Sigma Tau was out in full force.
"Let's go up and see her when this session is over.
Nora, please bring me my street clothes." As she spoke, Grace began rapidly divesting herself of her costume.
It was awful!" She shuddered, then burst into tears, burying her face in Jessica's shoulder.
We think you showed a great deal of the right kind of courage in making the public apology you did both to Miss Thompson and to us.
"To-morrow is one of my days at Mrs.
You will let me try, won't you?" she pleaded.
You can't see her yet, but you may all shake hands with her.
First her father, then her step-sister and now Eleanor.
"I believe you'd win at that," he said so earnestly that every one laughed.
She isn't worth bothering over.
Gray to the dining room.
Will you promise to help before I tell you?" "Why, of course," answered Grace and Anne in the same breath.
She glanced toward the back door.
From the day that Miss Thompson had taken her to task for absence, she had entertained a supreme contempt for the principal of which Miss Thompson was wholly unaware until, encountering Eleanor one morning in the corridor, the latter had stared at her with an expression of such open scorn and dislike that Miss Thompson felt her color rise.
One of the girls told me so.
For an instant the six girls stood still, regarding those strange apparitions with fascinated terror.
To be sure, Eleanor might refuse to go to school, but Grace had an idea that, lenient as Miss Nevin was with her niece, she would not allow Eleanor to go that far.
Now that they were in harmony with each other, they played with remarkable unity, and after an hour's practice Grace decided that they were in a fair way to "whip the seniors off the face of the earth." "I never saw you girls work better!" she exclaimed.
"They are all in this mix-up, and if they aren't suspended, they'll be lucky." "Are you going to stand up for Eleanor now, in the face of what she said about all of us before those girls, Grace?" asked Marian Barber hotly.
3 THE IRON BOYS ON THE ORE BOATS; Or, Roughing It on the Great Lakes.
"I really don't know how to approach her.
It would be well, however, to study the chosen play and become familiar with it; also each girl must bring a copy of the play with her.
"If I am ever foolish enough to fall in love, I certainly don't want to lose the object of my devotion." "You can't very well," said Grace slyly, "for from all present indications I should say that he is too fat to get lost." And Nora was obliged to explain elaborately to the laughing girls, all the way home, that the object of her future devotion would not be a fat man.
Harlowe just how it all happened.
"But I never have played with her," protested Ruth Deane, "and how do I know whether she can play?" "Try her," begged Edna.
I am still carrying the marks from the last whipping she gave me.
"I can't help feeling badly," said Grace, with a sob.
A dozen things beguiled them from the path.
"Why don't you hurry on home?" called Nora.
They carried out in every particular the description of the regulation churchyard ghost.
Cloth, Illustrated Price, per Volume, 50c.
This is my bedroom," she continued, pushing aside the silken curtains that separated the two rooms.
As most of the girls present had heard Anne recite, there was a great craning of necks and a faint murmur of expectancy as she took her place.
I was too angry at the time to trust myself to tell any one else.
'We must put ourselves in harmony with the things among which our lot is cast.'" "Well, Marcus Aurelius, we'll try to accept your teaching," laughed Grace, who immediately recognized the quotation as coming from a tiny "Marcus Aurelius Year Book" that Anne kept in her desk and frequently perused.
Where did you find them?" "That is a mystery which even Sherlock Holmes can never solve," replied Grace, laughing.
I saw several girls with the paper, but hadn't the remotest idea what it was all about.
THE PHI SIGMA TAU 53 VI.
She will probably beat me.
It was carried with enthusiasm before Grace had time to protest.
He spoke favorably of the idea of an all-girl cast, saying that each year many girls' colleges presented Shakespearian plays with marked success.
To clear up this mystery, should be a matter of vital interest to you, too, as this letter is really an insinuation against you." Grace was silent.
Very softly, you may be sure," continued Jessica, "but it was hissing, just the same.
We shout, we sing, the praises of the seniors." Hardly had the last notes died away, when the referee blew the whistle and the teams hustled to their positions.
As for Mabel, she collapsed utterly, crying as though her heart would break.
Besides, I'm too short." "But, Anne, you've had stage experience," said Jessica.
The girls exclaimed over the Circassian walnut furniture and could not decide as to which room was the prettier.
A RECKLESS CHAUFFEUR 129 XIII.
And I must also insist upon punctuality in future.
If she is absent the second day, then a messenger is sent to her home to find out the cause.
Then she turned the page, glanced at the signature, and gave a little cry of surprise.
She decided to go at once to Professor La Roche and apologize, so that he would not report her to Miss Thompson.
"Her life, of course, has been eventful, but I believe if we are to do her any good we shall just have to act as though she were an everyday girl like the rest of us.
Each book presents a vivid picture of some phase of this great industry.
Aside from the social part, their chief object would be to keep a watchful eye open for girls in school who needed assistance of any sort.
The sorority that Eleanor had mentioned in her letter to the Phi Sigma Tau, was now in full flower.
What do you play?" "Do you know Raff's 'Cavatina'?" asked Jessica a trifle shyly.
As she dressed for dinner, Grace felt perfectly happy except for one thing.
"All right; I accept the reproof," said Grace.
What on earth did you ever do to her, Grace?" But Grace could not answer.
Just wait until the next time I see her," blustered Nora, "I'll tell her what I think of her." "On the contrary, we must treat her better, if anything, than before," said Anne quietly.
Eleanor and Edna Wright were among the junior contestants, while there was a good showing of sophomores and freshmen.
He ought to be warned." "Who's going to rob the judge?
Before they had been on the floor twenty minutes the girls were thoroughly alive to the joy of the game and worked with the old-time dash and spirit that had won them the championship the previous year.
"Miss Tebbs must have had them moved to the other room.
Perhaps they were afraid of being waylaid." "I suppose they couldn't bear to see us win," said Grace.
You did not even take the trouble to have yourself appointed her guardian.
The duties of the class president are many and irksome.
"They are such noisy creatures already." There was more laughing at this, as Anne and Jessica were by far the quietest members of the sorority.
I shall not try to decide where I want to go for a while yet." "Wherever we are we'll write and always be friends," said Julia, and Grace warmly acquiesced.
Southard in his deep, musical voice.
"I will listen to your apology, Miss Savell," she said coldly.
Gray, allowing Grace to seat her in the big leather-covered arm chair.
She returned his love, and after a brief engagement they were married, much against the wishes of Margaret, who thought them both too young and impressionable to know their own minds." "And did they live happy ever after?" asked Grace eagerly.
"Grace, come here and speak to Mr.
Although the chums had not taken her into their inner circle, still they made much of her, and she came nearer to being one of them than any other girl in the junior class.
Lawyers always know everything about such things.
Wait and I'll get the music for you." After a moment's search she produced the music, picked up her violin, and, after tightening a string, announced herself ready.
She had not expected this honor and was deeply touched by it.
"That's the only thing that keeps me from your side.
Oh, I hope nothing has happened to the poor old judge." "Well, we'll soon know," replied the chief.
The branches creaked and the dry leaves fell rattling to the ground by hundreds.
"My aunt sent to New York for it.
She heard heavy footsteps, and, peeping into the room, she saw a burly figure outlined in the front door in the act of entering.
Her glance traveled from girl to girl, and she curled her lip contemptuously as her eye rested on Grace and Anne.
Let them keep their trumpery hatchet." With these words she turned and stalked across the field to the road, where her runabout stood.
No one ever says 'must' to me." "I say it to you now, Eleanor, and I mean it," said Grace.
"Don't keep us in suspense.
"She looks like the 'Vendetta' or the 'Camorra' or some other Italian vengeance agency, doesn't she?" said Nora with a giggle.
A girl who would wilfully do such a thing is a menace to the school and should be removed from it.
"Where's Anne?" said Grace as Nora paused in front of her.
"I should like to keep her with me all the time." "She is a nice child," said Grace, "and she deserves something better than her present fate." "To change the subject," said Nora, "has any one seen Eleanor to-day?
"I'll let you know as soon as I hear from Mary Stevens." "What a sweet little girl she is," said Jessica.
What has she done that you should speak of her as you do?" "She called me into her office this morning and made a whole lot of fuss because I didn't have a written excuse for yesterday's absence," said Eleanor angrily.
"It must have been something remarkable, or they wouldn't have subsided so suddenly." "It was," giggled Jessica.
"My dear child, you know that you may do as you please about it.
2 THE HIGH SCHOOL PITCHER; Or, Dick & Co.
If we begin to bow down to her, we shall be obliged to keep it up.
"I tell ye, Bill, we've got to do the job to-night and hike for the West on that train that goes through Oakdale at 3.15 in the morning," said a voice that was almost a growl.
She's all right now, but I am devoutly thankful she didn't play 'Rosalind,' for she certainly would not have done justice to it." Grace smiled grimly as she listened to Miss Tebbs.
If you are going to take such a serious view of this gay world, however, perhaps I'll wish I had joined the seniors, after all.
"We had a stormy enough time last year, goodness knows.
1 UNCLE SAM'S BOYS IN THE RANKS; Or, Two Recruits in the United States Army.
"Oh, you have the suite at the back," she exclaimed.
To the eager girls the day seemed particularly long, and a heartfelt sigh went up when the dismissal gong rang.
They've rehearsed both parts, and will be all right.
He will wait until he thinks I am far enough up the street and then he'll follow me.
He will help us," Grace concluded.
She touched the girl on the shoulder and said, "You seem to be in distress.
"I certainly did not," responded Mabel.
Nora thereupon took up the narrative and convulsed her hearers with the remedies tried by the fat prince to reduce his weight.
Just as though it wouldn't upset your team as much as ours.
She also requested me to mind my own business." "She said that to you?
Why didn't your prize orphan get out of the way with the rest of you?
Cloth, Illustrated Price, per Volume, 50c.
Grace, Nora, Anne and Jessica wished to recite in the same classes as far as could be arranged, and a lively confab ensued as to what would be best to take.
He and Miss Tebbs are going, too, and so is Mrs.
Then Grace began with her meeting with Mabel Allison and ended with the letter from Mary Stevens, enclosing the matron's statement.
The four girls arose and followed Mrs.
"Will it be possible for us to get Mabel away from Miss Brant, or can Miss Brant hold her against her will?" "Miss Stevens' letter and the matron's statement are sufficient," answered Mr.
Won't some of those girls put on airs, though.
"You know perfectly well that you've been shut up in your old laboratory all fall.
I just received word that you were missing.
"Well, here goes," and she hurried after Eleanor, overtaking her at the entrance to the school grounds.
So now you understand why I have told you all this.
"Has the kitty stolen your tongue?" This was too much for Eleanor.
Gray forced this recent humiliation upon me.
"She deserves to be punished.
"Will you do as I wish?" The tears rushed to Grace's eyes.
The walking expedition wouldn't be complete without him." "I'll write to him to-night," said David.
You might get through the first act in a borrowed gown, Anne, but what can you do in the second?
Three ghostly figures swathed in white stole out from the shadow of the pines and glided down the wide, graveled drive toward the gate.
"What do you mean by dressing up like this?
I don't like the idea of being the only boy, you know." "David and Tom," said Grace and Anne.
High School yell next, please." By the time the party had reached the center of the town where their ways parted, the shadow cast by the near accident had almost disappeared.
Last year we gave a ball, but this year so far we have done nothing.
However, I'm not going to bother much about the play now, for the senior team has just sent me a challenge to play them Saturday, December 12th.
THE LAST STRAW 173 XVIII.
"I am afraid we can't do much for her.
Are you making mud pies or are you pretending you are at the seashore?" At Julia's first words Eleanor dropped the small spade she held and straightened up, the picture of defiance.
Attendance is one of the chief requisites in Miss Thompson's eyes." "I suppose we ought to call on Eleanor before long," mused Grace.
Admiration for Grace and her friends had taken the place of the old animosity.
I can't stop to tell you about it now, but you shall hear as soon as I have a chance.
He can entertain a regiment of them, and not even exert himself.
Put them together, and they will make a bad combination.
* * * * * The day of the picnic dawned fair and cloudless.
Southard pleasantly, indicating Marian Barber, who rather timidly obeyed, taking the book he held out to her.
"You all know," continued the principal, "that it is strictly forbidden for any pupil to absent herself from school for the purpose of attending a circus, matinée or any public performance of this nature.
"'Where are you going, my pretty maid?'" said David Nesbit, stopping directly in front of Grace Harlowe as she hurried toward the Bright home the following Thursday evening.
We'll feel more like walking after we've rested a little." "Let us all sit in a row with our backs against this fallen tree and tell a story," said Grace.
The Phi Sigma Tau were seated in one end of the second wagon, with the exception of Grace, who had perched herself on the driver's seat, and was holding an animated conversation with the driver, old Jerry Flynn, whom every one knew and liked.
"You don't know Grace Harlowe.
Their penalty was far from light, but they had not been suspended, and so they resolved to endure it as best they might.
For my part, I think Miss Wells would have been a better secretary.
They were going to rob and perhaps murder good old Judge Putnam.
Groups of girls indignantly denied even the thought of such mischief.
"But now that I'm here, I am willing to try it." "Come this way." "Girls," said Grace, addressing the three blindfolded girls, "this is Eleanor Savell.
I wonder if she knows how late it is?" Sure enough, Anne was hurrying toward the opposite dressing room.
"He is head over heels in football practice and has forgotten he ever knew Jessica.
You deserve double congratulations for the part you played behind the scenes." "It was nothing," murmured Grace, her color rising.
Up the steps she hurried, meeting no one, for Miss Nevin was at Assembly Hall and the servants' quarters were at the back of the house.
"This is my third year in Oakdale High School, and I never had any good times until I came here.
Gray told me that Miss Nevin was anxious that Eleanor should associate with girls of her own age.
As she briskly delivered the opening lines, the actor stopped her.
"I--just--had a queer idea," faltered Grace.
Perhaps you'll be too far advanced for our class." "Never fear, my dear," said Eleanor.
They now sang with the utmost glee, and came out particularly strong on the chorus, which ran: "The juniors forever, hurrah, fans, hurrah!
No one had ever before spoken so disrespectfully to their revered principal.
As for Grace and her friends, Eleanor was particularly bitter against them, and laid at their door a charge of which they were entirely innocent.
To settle Miss Thompson was not so easy a matter, and though Eleanor racked her brain for some telling method of vengeance, no inspiration came until one afternoon in early March.
The sprightly old lady was never so happy as when surrounded by young folks.
"That's what you always say," exclaimed Nora.
Here, Miriam Nesbit, still unsubdued, endeavored once more to humiliate Anne Pierson, and to oust Grace from her position as captain of the basketball team, being aided in her plan by Julia Crosby, captain of the junior team, against whom the sophomores had engaged to play a series of three games.
She has disliked Miss Thompson from the first." "I wonder whether she apologized to Miss Thompson last night," mused Grace.
"She was here when I came in this morning, and I was early, too.
"I shall sit at the feet of the fair Jessica.
You can 'phone to her from my house." In another minute the young people had seated themselves in the big car and were off.
"She won't attend the meeting." "How do you know?" asked Jessica.
"You played like professionals." "Eleanor is a better player than Edna Wright," said Grace.
"She tends to all her correspondence.
"Grace," she said, as the young girl entered the office, "were you in my office yesterday afternoon between half past one and a quarter of two?" "Why, yes, Miss Thompson.
I can't remember." Then, folding the paper, she tossed it to Anne, who nodded; then wrote, "Mabel Allison," and handed it to the girl sitting opposite her, who obligingly passed it over to Grace.
"She's down on me now, and she'll be sure to think I organized the whole thing." For an instant Grace regretted making the promise to Julia, before learning the situation; then, holding her head a trifle more erect, she decided to make the best of her unfortunate predicament.
The things she said to Miss Thompson were disgraceful, and I shall never forgive her for the way she spoke of us." "I wouldn't say that, Grace," remarked Anne.
It was fifteen minutes past seven by the city hall clock, and she did not wish to be late.
"She is about to have a conniption.
"Remember, we practise to-morrow after school," called Grace as she separated from her team at her street.
"You will be spared any obnoxious vegetables, even though the others may suffer." "For that you walk," said David, who had dropped Hippy and was engaged in helping the girls into the machine.
You remember the hatchet that we buried last year with such pomp and ceremony?" "Yes, yes," was the answer.
I wouldn't cut up anything alive for all the world.
A brief meeting was held, and the girls were assigned to their positions.
They were sitting down front on the same side as Eleanor's crowd.
Varied hyphenation where a consensus could not be ascertained, retained.
"Let us hold her place in this sorority open for her, and let us make it our business to be ready to help her if she needs us," said Anne thoughtfully.
As she hurried into the library she looked back, but saw no sign of David.
Before Mabel had time to answer, a tall, raw-boned woman, with a hard, forbidding face, shoved her aside and confronted them.
"It will be a sorry day for the seniors when we line up on the twelfth." "There'll be a great gnashing of senior teeth after the game," remarked Nora confidently.
She always does whatever she sets out to do." "She's a regular fairy godmother," said Anne softly.
Their faces were white as their robes, and blue flames played about their eyes.
Don't say you don't want me, for I have made up my mind; and it is like the laws of the Medes and Persians, unchangeable." "We shall be glad to welcome a new classmate, of course," responded Grace.
Miss Brant is liable to inform the police, and they might not look at initiation stunts as we do." "That's right," said James, looking a trifle alarmed.
If Eleanor could only understand that she must respect the authority of her various teachers during recitation hours and cheerfully comply with their requests, then all might be well.
"Why, Miss Thompson," she cried, "you surely don't think I tore up your essay?" "No, Grace, I don't," replied the principal.
Those in favor say 'aye.' We'll dispense with seconding the motion." There was an instant's pause, then a chorus of "ayes" burst forth.
Grace's plain speaking had roused a tempest in her.
"That was an evenly matched game," exclaimed Nora, as Grace and Miriam strolled to where their friends were seated upon the grass.
Without looking to the right or left, Eleanor walked proudly up the aisle to her seat, followed by the gaze of those girls who could not refrain from watching her.
The view from the windows is so beautiful, and as one grows old, one resorts more and more to book friendships." "What shall we do with you, Mrs.
When Grace repeated Eleanor's remark about having made up her mind, the old lady looked a little troubled.
I have this satisfaction, however, that I would not have met with you to-night, at any rate.
Knowing that, do you suppose you can make her believe that you did not hide Anne's costumes?" Eleanor's insolent expression turned to one of fear.
There was a great craning of necks from those at the one table to see the central figures on the other, but soon every one settled down to the discussion of the dainties provided for them.
We are about to organize a sorority of our own.
Just be patient for a few days, and don't be afraid.
When the two teams appeared on the field there were shouts of enthusiasm from the friends of the players, and the band burst forth with the High School song, in which the students joined.
"Here's a letter, Miss Jessica," she said.
I dare say I shall go to-morrow, providing I get up in time." "What an irresponsible girl Eleanor is," remarked Anne, as they walked along.
"No, the judge has no 'phone.
She has decided she likes us, and that settles it," said Grace, smiling.
It was geometry hour, and Miss Ames, the geometry teacher, had just reproved Eleanor for inattention.
She ought to be put in jail for exceeding the speed limit." "Hush!" said Grace.
"My, but it's great to be here," said Tom Gray to Grace as they entered Upton Wood.
Compare the price charged you for Altemus books with the price demanded for other juvenile books.
She makes perfectly ridiculous caricatures of him, and leaves them on his desk when class is over, and she asks him to translate impertinent slang phrases, which he does, sometimes, before he realizes how they are going to sound.
The front one was absolutely bare, but the back one contained an old stove, a broken-down sink and a rickety chair.
Across the stage she flew and into the other dressing room.
A THANKSGIVING FROLIC 137 XIV.
I'll have a burglar alarm put in at once and a telephone, too.
She drove back even faster than she had come.
She has always kept it in repair.
"I am just as enthusiastic over basketball as ever, only I haven't had the time to devote to it that I did last year." "Never mind, you'll make up for lost time after Thanksgiving," said Anne soothingly.
"Why don't you all take French, it is such a beautiful language," said a soft voice behind them.
I believe she will try to influence the rest of the class against us." "She'll have to hurry up if she does it this term," said Nora.
"What is this I hear about losing your costumes, Anne?" asked Miss Tebbs rather impatiently.
If you have anything to say to me, Miss Brant, you can always find me at my office on East Main Street.
I suppose that when Miss Thompson looked over the list, she remembered seeing you at opening exercises, so of course sent for you." "She is a crabbed old maid," said Eleanor contemptuously, "and I despise her.
"She'll try to be the whole cast, and will get a magnificent case of sulks if she can't have her own way." "Sh-h-h," warned Eva Allen.
Also the lines in the text where Rosalind refers to her height underwent some changes.
"What shall I do?" Grace breathed, wringing her hands.
Forgetful of her promise, Grace wandered farther and farther on, gathering the wild flowers as she went.
Bright beamed on the three girls, raised his hat and hurried down the street, leaving them to proceed slowly toward Jessica's home.
Gray." "Thank you," said Grace, speaking for the girls.
"I might have been murdered in cold blood.
Southard took in the aspirants with keen, comprehensive glance.
So I'll have to get the team together and go to work." "We're awfully late this year about starting.
Every one of those teachers are common, low-bred and impertinent.
She felt worried for Eleanor's sake, because she saw trouble ahead for her unless she changed her tactics.
I know what I am talking about because I used to be just as ridiculous as she is, and knowing what you suffered through me, I can't bear to see you unhappy again over some one who is too trivial to be taken seriously." "You're a dear, Miriam!" exclaimed Nora impulsively.
It had been a mild fall, with a late Indian summer, and only one or two snow flurries that had lasted but a few hours.
"But, my dear child, Anne Pierson is to play Rosalind," replied Miss Tebbs.
What's the matter with her?
"It isn't Julia's fault," she thought.
"Here's the lost girl now.
I'm very glad to see so many Oakdale children out to-day." "How dare you take possession of the very spot we had our eye on?" asked Grace, as she shook hands with David.
"Thank you very much, Miss Tebbs." "You are welcome," replied the teacher.
"We have always tried to put her best side out to dear Mrs.
I am sorry I didn't tell you while in the locker-room, but you would insist on having secrets, so I thought I'd have one, too." "Well, it can't be helped now," said Grace.
The instant the last bell sounded on lessons, ten girls made for their lockers, and fifteen minutes later the first team and the subs.
"The next thing to do is----" But a loud ring of the door bell interrupted her speech and caused the whole party to start.
"I have a plan I think she'll listen to." In the meantime, on reaching home Grace had been cried over by her mother and put to bed as though she were a baby.
"They're not here," she announced after a brief but thorough search.
Draw up your chairs and sit in a circle.
"She can go to that, even though she is on bad terms with the school." The recess bell cut short the conversation and the girls returned to their desks with far better ideas of the coming game than of the afternoon's lessons.
Anne had been absent from one rehearsal and thus Eleanor had had an opportunity to show her ability.
Emblematic of this they buried a hatchet, once occupying a humble though honorable position in the Crosby family, but cheerfully sacrificed for the good of the cause.
At first she found nothing of importance, but suddenly she began to laugh softly, her face lighted with malicious glee.
For a wonder every one was on time, and the start was made with a great fluttering of handkerchiefs, accompanied by enthusiastic cheers and High School yells.
When, with the exception of Eleanor, the principal dismissed them, they filed decorously out, very uneasy in mind.

It was an old colonial residence, the surrounding grounds extending for a block.
To have Miriam a member of his own particular "crowd" had always been David's dearest wish, and the advent of Arnold Evans had done away with Miriam being the odd one.
"It's a case of Ireland forever, isn't it Nora?" said Grace teasingly.
Rosalind's costumes had to be altered to fit Anne, however, on account of her lack of stature.
What I insist upon knowing now, is who are the real culprits, beginning with the girl who originated the paper to the last one who signed it.
Leaving the runabout outside the grounds, she ran up the drive, and, inserting her key in the door, opened it softly and entered the wide, old-fashioned hall.

Well, Eleanor and her crowd saw them, and what do you suppose they did?" "Hard to tell," said Nora.
"Everything is bound to change in this world, you know.
CHAPTER XIII A THANKSGIVING FROLIC But sudden as had been Mabel's fall, Grace Harlowe was equal to the emergency.
"I have never been punished in my life, therefore I am not liable to give you the first opportunity.
The seniors did not intend to allow them to score again in a hurry.
The girl using the spade was Eleanor.
"One minute he vows to walk until he reaches the skeleton stage, and the next he threatens to kick over all his vows by overeating." "I didn't say anything about overeating," retorted Hippy.
"I am very glad to see so many girls here," she said.

"Pardon me," said Grace, glancing up, then seized the girl by the arm.
"I wonder what I had better do," Grace mused.
You shan't stop school if I can help it.
Miss Thompson dislikes having the girls stay out." "I can't help what Miss Thompson dislikes," returned Eleanor, laughing.
Are any of you going to be over ambitious and take five?" "Not I," responded Grace and Jessica in chorus.
Grace, Nora, Eleanor and Miriam had ably supported her and there had been tears of proud joy in Miss Tebbs's eyes as she had watched the clever and spirited acting of these girls.
To have them forget that one is anything except the living, breathing person whose character one is trying to portray.
"All those in favor say 'aye,' contrary, 'no.'" "Carried," said Grace, as no dissenting voices arose.
"What do you girls think of it?" she asked, turning to Eva, Marian and Eleanor, who had so far expressed no opinion.
"As for the ghosts, they are very likely at home by this time." CHAPTER VI A VISIT TO ELEANOR The next day, when Grace, in company with her chums, left the school building, they beheld the shabby little figure of Mabel Allison waiting for them just outside the campus.
"You couldn't drive me home," replied Jessica promptly.
Grace gave a long sigh and leaned back in the big chair.
"They're in the wardrobe in my bedroom." "All right, wait for me at the door and don't say a word.
I hear you've adopted a girl, too.
She will pretend she doesn't understand him and will make him explain the construction of a sentence over and over again, or she will argue with him about a point until he loses his temper completely.
She is helping to destroy that spirit of earnestness that you have tried so hard to cultivate.
Why didn't you let me go along?
I've seen ever so many pictures of him and read magazine articles about him.

"I came over to try my bird before I have it sent home for the winter," replied David.
If I am anywhere near here when your play is enacted, I shall make it a point to come and see it." Shaking hands warmly with Miss Tebbs and bowing to the admiring girls, Mr.
"How cruelly you misjudge me," said Hippy.
Don't attempt to deny it." Eleanor looked contemptuously at Grace and tried to shake herself free, but Grace's grasp tightened.
"What's the matter, Anne?" asked Grace.
"Well, Eleanor's note is the last straw.
For three days Eleanor had remained in her room, refusing to speak to her aunt, who, at the end of that time, decreed that if she did not at once apologize roundly and return to school her violin and piano would both be taken from her until she should again become reasonable.
It was addressed to the "Phi Sigma Tau, care of Miss Jessica Bright." "Why, who in the world can this be from?
"I always feel hungry after such strenuous exercise as walking.
Hippy clamored incessantly for food.
"Don't plan too much, until you find out whether you can snatch her from the dragon's claws." "I feel sure we shall win," replied Grace confidently.
Jessica wanted to take physical geography, Anne rhetoric, and Grace boldly announced a hankering for zoölogy.
1 DICK PRESCOTT'S FIRST YEAR AT WEST POINT; Or, Two Chums in the Cadet Gray.
In the face of this new punishment, which was the severest penalty that could be imposed upon her, Eleanor remained obdurate.
By the time school was over for the day, the girls of the Phi Sigma Tau knew that Eleanor had once more repudiated their overtures of friendship and were curious to see what she had written.
Ethel Dumont can play Miriam's part.
David Nesbit's trial flight in his aëroplane, Grace's encounter with the escaped lunatic, who imagined himself to be Napoleon Bonaparte, were among the features which made the book absorbing from start to finish.
You may apologize to me now, and to-morrow to the girls you have accused of treachery, or you may leave this school, not to return to it unless permitted to do so by the Board of Education." Without a word Eleanor rose and walked haughtily out of the room.
When Mabel appeared, her shabby hat in her hand, Miss Brant reached forward and tore the hat from her.
She stopped, hesitated, then went softly in, a half-formed idea in her mind that did not at first assume definite shape.
What do you suppose he is doing in Oakdale, and at the High School--of all places?" "Time will tell," said Nora.
"She knows us too well for that." But it was with a peculiar apprehension of something unpleasant that Grace answered a summons to the principal's office just before school closed for the day.
Miss Tebbs, looking a trifle impatient, stood awaiting her reply.
They went to Leipsic, and Edith, who had high hopes of one day becoming a concert pianiste, continued her studies under the best instructors that money could procure.
CHAPTER III AN AUTUMN WALKING EXPEDITION "It is simply too lovely to go home to-day," exclaimed Grace Harlowe to her three chums as they strolled down High School Street one sunny afternoon in early October.
I'll tell her." "May I go with you, Anne?" asked Grace.
"It would wear me out to be with her continually, she is so changeable." "Mrs.
Nestling at the foot of the elevation on the side opposite to the one she had climbed stood a small one-story cottage.
Grace thought "Phi Sigma Tau" would sound well.
The dressing had been going on for the last hour, and now a goodly company of courtiers and dames stood about waiting while Miss Tebbs and Miss Kane rapidly "made up their faces" with rouge and powder.
She had told no one of her interview with Miss Thompson.
"Besides, she might be very angry and take her spite out on poor Mabel.
As school had closed at half past two, it was not yet four o'clock.
ELEANOR FINDS A WAY 145 XV.
"She is different from the rest of us.
"After they had been married a little over two years, a little girl came to them, and the older sister loved the tiny baby as dearly as she loved her beautiful, young step-mother." "Why, that sounds very much like Grimm's fairy tales!" exclaimed Nora.
On the other side of the street was a field where the small fry of Oakdale usually held their ball games.
"I suppose you are going to enter our school, are you not?
The moment she turned the corner, Eleanor darted out of the lavatory and fled down the corridor, just as the bell rang for the end of the period.
Bright, as he rang the bell.
"There are eight of them.
Up it went, the whistle sounded and the two captains sprang straight for it.

"Well, little folks," said Julia in mock surprise, "what sort of a party is this?
Grace alone netted four foul goals, and the sensational playing of Nora and Miriam was a matter of wonder to the spectators, who conceded it to be the fastest, most brilliant half ever played by an Oakdale team.

"Oh, I didn't think it was so late.
"I want all my girls to try particularly this year to reach a higher standard than ever before," Miss Thompson concluded, "not only in your studies, but in your attitude toward one another.
Before eleven o'clock everything was finished, and as she arranged the last flower in its vase she felt a little thrill of pride as she looked about the pretty drawing room.
"Are you going to tell Miss Thompson?" "So far I have told nothing, Eleanor," said Grace sternly.
On Wednesday, aside from a little more whispering and significant glances exchanged among the pupils, not a ripple disturbed the calm of the study hall.
Basketball enthusiasm declined rapidly and a remarkable devotion to study ensued that lasted until examinations began.
I don't believe we shall get along with her very well." "I'll tell you girls a secret," replied Grace.
The girl was Anne Pierson, who in some mysterious manner had been all but overlooked, until Miss Tebbs spied her standing between Grace and Nora.

CHAPTER XVII THE LAST STRAW The days glided by rapidly.
"I hope you will soon be one of us.
Gray, "and the reason that I have told you this long tale is because the baby girl is almost a woman now, and----" "The girl is Eleanor Savell and we met her the other day," broke in Grace excitedly, forgetting for an instant that she had interrupted Mrs.
"O Julia, how glad I am to see you at close range!" exclaimed Grace.
She lost no time in sending for them, and after a session in the office, they emerged looking subdued and crestfallen; and after that it was noted that when in conversation with their schoolmates, they made no further allusion to Miss Thompson's methods of discipline.
Out of the eighty girls, about thirty-five only stepped over to the side from which the principal characters were to be chosen.
I can't stay with you any longer, just now, because I am going to Miss Bright's and I am late.
Grace looked curiously about her.
"'The goblins will git you, ef you don't watch out.'" "Don't tease," said Marian Barber, looking rather foolish.
"But, O girls, I am so proud of our invincible team.
"Report says that this movement originated in the junior class, and that a paper has been circulated and signed by certain pupils, who pledged themselves to play truant and attend the matinée to-morrow." The eyes of Grace and her chums turned questioningly toward Mabel Allison, who nodded slightly in the affirmative.
Be sure and be there at a quarter of four at the latest." Promptly at the appointed time the girls hurried up the Harlowe walk.
Let her put tags on herself if she wants to.
They arrived only a few days ago." Grace rapidly narrated their meeting and conversation with Eleanor, while Mrs.
"Begin after I have counted three.

She knew the principal would insist on an apology from Eleanor, and neither she nor her friends wished it.
"The rest o' the bunch'll be at the weddin' of one o' the girls.
2 THE YOUNG ENGINEERS IN ARIZONA; Or, Laying Tracks on the "Man-Killer" Quicksand.
For an elderly woman, she really is interesting." "We call her our fairy godmother," said Anne, "and love her so dearly that we never think of her as being old." There had been something about the careless words that jarred upon Anne.
"Hippy, you are on the end, so you can begin it, then after you have gone a little way, Nora must take up the narrative, and so on down the line until the story is finished." "Fine," said Hippy.
"Come on," said Eleanor, taking her by the arm and dragging her over to the piano.
She had just reached there when Eleanor walked in, looking extremely sulky.
She was one of those tender-hearted girls who disliked being on bad terms with any one, and she really liked Eleanor still, in spite of the fact that Eleanor did not in the least return the sentiment.
Then the whole class laughs at him.
"It's a wonder those boys didn't put tick-tacks on the windows or do something like that." The girls had come to the turn of the street, and were about to pass the only really lonely spot during their walk.
Mark my words, some day she'll be glad to come back to the Phi Sigma Tau." CHAPTER IX THE RESCUE PARTY It was with mingled feelings of excitement and trepidation that Grace Harlowe and Jessica Bright hurried toward the office of the latter's father the following afternoon.
There's a shining example of consistency for you!" "Who on earth told her about the meeting?" said Jessica.
As dancing was the chief amusement at nearly all of the young people's parties in Oakdale, the floor was filled from the beginning of the first waltz until supper was announced.
So we will have just time enough after school to go home and dress." "You had better meet at my house, then," said Grace, "for it's on the way to Mrs.
"'The play's the thing,'" quoted Nora, "and me for it." "That is for the judges to decide," said Jessica sagely.
Thank goodness, it's not cold to-day or we might have a chilly vigil.
"While I'm here, I'll just look about and see if I can't find some way to even up that public apology she made me make." Gliding over to the open desk, she ran her eye hastily over the various papers spread out upon it.
She was engaged to be married to a young English officer, and he died of fever while stationed in India.
"Tell me what your trouble is.
"I can't bear to have secrets and not tell you." "That's all right, Mabel," said Marian Barber, patting her on the shoulder.
"I have never before heard an amateur read those lines as well as you have to-day, Miss Pierson," he said.
Her coat was thrown open, disclosing a perfectly tailored gown of brown, with trimmings of dull gold braid.
That would mislead David, although no doubt he would find them before the evening was over.
Besides, I have an idea that I am as fond of having my own way as she is." "Dinner is served," announced John, the butler.
"It's all right," he said, hanging up.
You have even given football the go by, and I'm so sorry, for you were a star player last year." "I see you have discovered the secrets of my past life," replied David, laughing.
They were really only half sisters, and the one was almost twenty years older than the other.
Grace thought she had never seen Eleanor looking more beautiful.
Grace wore a little knapsack fitted to her back with two cross straps.
"You are our captain," she declared to Grace, "and the best center I ever saw on a girls' team.
I hated her the first time I ever saw her, but the matron said I was old enough to work, that I'd have a good home with her and that I should be paid for my work.
"Do you see the time?" said Nora, suddenly pointing to the old-fashioned clock in the corner.
Never had they seen such an exhibition of temper.
Marian and Eva Allen followed her, and acquitted themselves with credit.
"I am so glad you changed your mind and came.
Grace walked with Julia, and the two girls found plenty to say to each other during the walk.
"May she come here first?
"Will you please tell me if any one is hurt?" she asked pettishly.
"You may say what you like about the artistic temperament," said Nora, "but in my opinion it's nothing more nor less than just plain temper." CHAPTER VIII ELEANOR THROWS DOWN THE GAUNTLET "The Phi Sigma Tau is to have a special meeting to-night at Jessica's," called Grace Harlowe to Nora O'Malley as the latter entered the locker-room at the close of school one day about two weeks after the initiation at Jessica's.

Once they stopped and played hide and seek for half an hour.
"I paid for that hat and for the clothes you're wearing, and you'll send every stitch you've on back to me, or I'll have you arrested for stealing." [Illustration: "Don't You Dare Leave This House With My Property."] "Come on, Mabel," said Grace, putting her arm around the shrinking little figure.
"How dark it is growing," exclaimed Jessica, as they again took the road.
So the Phi Sigma Tau signed their names and the note was passed to Eleanor directly after recess.
With a nod of thanks to Anne, Grace glanced at the paper and then at the owner of the name, who sat with her hands meekly folded on her desk, listening to Miss Thompson as though her life depended upon hearing every word that the principal uttered.
In "GRACE HARLOWE'S SENIOR YEAR AT HIGH SCHOOL; Or, The Parting of the Ways," we shall learn how the Phi Sigma Tau kept their sorority pledge.
Still, on the whole, Grace felt glad that so far no one knew the truth.
Harlowe as she stood on the veranda and watched them out of sight.
She has remarkable beauty and talent, but she is frightfully self-willed.
"Do you intend to obey me, Miss Savell?" asked Miss Thompson.
"You know I'd love to have you," Anne replied.
They held a scroll between them on which was printed the Thanksgiving Proclamation.
In order to avoid any possibility of hurt feelings, she had quietly requested those invited to wear the afternoon gowns in which they would appear at the game.
"Why do you say that, Grace?" "You've heard about the last straw that broke the camel's back, haven't you?" asked Grace.
I can hold it until 8.30, but no longer.
I should like to know how she knew I was absent yesterday." "Miss Thompson always knows when a girl is absent," replied Grace.
"That is putting it rather strongly.
"Oh, no," replied Eleanor lightly.
Every one was obliged to do something, if only to make a remark appropriate to the occasion.
"We'll take you girls to the football game next Thursday.
3 THE MEADOW-BROOK GIRLS AFLOAT; Or, The Stormy Cruise of the Red Rover.
I met Eleanor on the stairs and told her about the meeting, and that you were waiting in the locker-room for her.
Suddenly Tom amazed them all by putting his hands to his mouth and blowing a strange kind of hollow whistle that sounded like the note of a trumpet.
It's a shame to waste such perfect days as these." "What a perfectly lovely stunt!" exclaimed Grace.
I had intended to ask Aunt Margaret to take me out of this ridiculous school, for some of the people in it make me tired, but I have changed my mind.
"She probably knows nothing about our acquaintance with Eleanor; besides, Eleanor has no business to play such tricks.
THE JUNIOR PICNIC 235 XXIV.
He always keeps it around, and that old Putnam place is pretty well back from the road." Grace waited to hear no more.
I wish to talk further with you." "I'll come," promised Mabel, her face lighting up.
Gray's beautiful home, Anne said in a low tone to Grace, who was walking with her, "I suppose Mrs.
Of all the brave little girls----" The ringing of the telephone cut the chief short.

The darkness of a moonless night settled down upon her before she had gone three miles, but she would not allow herself to think of fear.
The latter looked as helpless and friendless as when Grace first saw her step up on the platform to receive her money.
It belonged to my grandfather," she confided to the girls when they had exclaimed over it.
Twice she attempted to speak and failed.
"Like all spoiled children, she is sure to get into mischief, and just as sure to come to grief.
You are a pretty good judge of character." "I don't know yet," replied Anne slowly.
We did not wish it.
"You are the rarest jewel in the casket.
"Perhaps we'll challenge you some day, Reddy," said Grace mischievously.
Harlowe, while Hippy wore a long-sleeved gingham pinafore of Grace's, which lacked considerable of meeting in the back, and was kept on by means of a sash.
She looks like a Dresden shepherdess grown old.
"What is her latest crime?" Grace felt like saying "Destroying other people's property and getting innocent folks disliked," but refrained.
"Not yet," replied Grace, "but she will as soon as she comes in.
on it in big, white letters.
It's sure to be short this morning." It was customary on the opening of school for the members of the various classes to take their seats of the previous year.
It is some masterpiece of mischief on her part, or she wouldn't take the trouble to get here on time." "Here comes Mabel," said Jessica.
"They left before the game was over.
They had stayed until the moon came up, and, accompanied by the old hunter, had walked back to Oakdale in the moonlight.
Then the guests formed two long lines from the living room straight through the big archway into the drawing room, and soon a Virginia reel was in full swing, led off by Mr.
In the center of the other table were two dolls, one dressed in football uniform, a miniature football under its arm, while the other, dressed as a High School girl, held up a blue banner with O.
Nora was the second Phi Sigma Tau to undergo the ordeal.
"Run, girls, run!" "Run nothing," exclaimed Nora.
This ended the first half, with the score 5 to 2 in favor of the juniors.
3 THE CIRCUS BOYS IN DIXIE LAND; Or, Winning the Plaudits of the Sunny South.
Goodness knows what the three of them will plan." She decided to turn down a side street, go back one block and into the public library.
She sent me out on an errand, but I felt as though I must be alone, if only for a few minutes.
Opening it, Grace found nothing save a dilapidated old coat.
"Where are they?" [Illustration: "Where Are Anne's Costumes?" Cried Grace.] "Let me go," said Eleanor angrily.
"Speaking of walking," remarked Hippy, "I have decided to go in for a little on my own account.
Is that too expensive?" The girls, who, with the exception of Anne, had small allowances of their own, expressed themselves satisfied; while Anne determined that for once she was justified in yielding to wild extravagance.
I am going to ask Mrs.
Reddy circled about the victors almost too delighted for words.
"Let's hope she will appreciate the honor of having four such distinguished persons descend upon her at one time," said Anne.
Everything will come right." "How can I ever thank you all?" said Mabel, taking one of Grace's hands between hers and looking at her with a world of gratitude in her eyes.
It was due to her that we came here," said Eleanor.
You'd better sing the tune to yourself all the time you're writing it, then you'll be sure to put more dash and spirit into it." "I wish the day of the game were here," said Jessica plaintively.
The Phi Sigma Tau entered in a body.
"It is a pity that Eleanor has taken up with Edna Wright.
As they neared the old Omnibus House they could see no one about.
"I value your good opinion above everything, but I can tell you nothing you wish to know.
They come next to you three girls with me, now." "I think that we all feel the same about them," replied Grace.
She is one of the candidates." "Ah, ha!" exclaimed David.
A NEW ARRIVAL 7 II.
You must understand, however, that once having given out a part, I should not attempt to take it from the girl I had given it to simply because some other girl desired it.
She always believed that I had been stolen.
It will be so pleasant to rehearse with her, considering that she isn't on speaking terms with any of us." Had the girl chums known then what Eleanor "was up to," it would have been a matter of surprise and indignation to all of them.
The applause was tremendous and the cast were obliged to bow their thanks several times before it subsided.
I am going there this afternoon.
None of her friends were implicated, either.
Grace motioned the girls to hurry.
"You know I was with you at recess, right after the paper had been passed to me.
CHAPTER XXI BREAKERS AHEAD The dress rehearsal for "As You Like It" was over.
Gray that we would try to help her?" "Yes, I remember all that; but I can't bear to have any one say horrid things to Grace," grumbled Nora.
"Wasn't it nice of Miss Thompson to exonerate us publicly?" asked Anne.
Neither class has played tricks on the other since peace was declared, and we don't want to begin now.
"They would never have dared to go that far." "I don't know about that," said Nora O'Malley.
"I can't understand how Eleanor could be so rude and disagreeable to her.
It had been well nigh perfect.
Let me know how many tickets you want for the game." He raised his cap, mounted his machine and was off down the street.
In order that each member of the cast may be chosen on her merit alone, my old friend, Mr.
She has found friends who are willing to help her until she finishes her education, and she wishes to go to them." "Oh, she does, does she?" sneered the woman mockingly.
Now about the football game.
I might lose my breath and never, never catch it again." "Oh, let him go," said Nora, who had accompanied them down the walk.
1 THE MOTOR BOAT CLUB OF THE KENNEBEC; Or, The Secret of Smugglers' Island.
I don't know who else is in it.
"We saw you just as you tackled Eleanor," said Nora, "so we kept away, for we thought after to-day's performances she wouldn't be in a very good humor." "What was the matter with her to-day?" asked Jessica curiously.
"Whatever she may do in future," thought Grace, as she listened to the last plaintive notes of the "Cavatina," "I'll forgive her for her music's sake.
"It is true that no one has particularly requested me to take charge of this meeting, but as I posted the notice, I feel that I am responsible for your presence here to-day.
Then she colored, looked grave and, putting the note in the back of the text-book she was holding, went on studying.
"Don't you know Reddy Brooks when you see him?
"I was afraid when first I saw them that they might be our boys.
On opening the envelope the pieces of her own note fell out, with a half sheet of paper containing the words, "Declined with thanks." CHAPTER XII A RECKLESS CHAUFFEUR Thanksgiving Day dawned bright and clear, with just enough frost in the air to make one's blood tingle.
He had a large sum of money in the house, not to mention old family silver and other valuables.
I'll find some way to get even with her, and all the rest of those teachers, too." "You will never get along in school, Eleanor," answered Grace gently, "if you take that stand.
In order to facilitate matters, he suggested that those girls who really desired speaking parts step to one side of the room, while those who wished merely to make the stage pictures, step to the other.
Let us go at once, for I must be back here at five o'clock." "What are you going to say to that terrible woman, papa?" shuddered Jessica as they neared the Brant home.
"Does Jessica know it?" inquired Nora.
"That will do," said Mr.
Grace, Nora, Anne and Miriam stood their ground and awaited the oncoming spectres, who halted when they saw that the girls did not intend to run.
1 THE BATTLESHIP BOYS AT SEA; Or, Two Apprentices in Uncle Sam's Navy.
"You play with considerable expression," said Eleanor, as Jessica rose from the piano stool.
Don't stop for a minute.
A hasty glance inside the office revealed to Grace that the principal was not there.
Come here, Anne, and prove the truth of my words." Grace drew a long breath of relief.
2 GRACE HARLOWE'S SOPHOMORE YEAR AT HIGH SCHOOL; Or, The Record of the Girl Chums in Work and Athletics.
Gray, and does it begin with 'Once upon a time'?" queried Jessica.
Object, to become a light weight.
"By the way," said Grace, after they had returned to the sitting room and were comfortably settled, "you never said one word about my freshman prize girl.
The Christmas holidays came, bringing with them the usual round of gayeties.
"I am saving my news for the meeting." By this time the remaining members of the Phi Sigma Tau, with the exception of Eleanor Savell, had come into the locker-room, and had been promptly hailed by Grace.
Let's talk about the present situation." She looked at Edna with the old-time aggravating smile that was always warranted to further incense her opponent.
"When she wrote me of Eleanor, I wrote her about my girls, and offered her 'Heartsease.' She was delighted with the whole thing and lost no time in getting here.
I can speak French, German, Italian and Spanish almost as well as English.
To be sure they had unlimited faith in Jessica's father, but it was so much easier to talk about taking Mabel away from Miss Brant than to do it.
"How childish she is," thought Grace.
Am I invited to be present at a suffragette's meeting or is Jessica simply anxious to show me what nice friends she has?" "No compliments allowed," laughed Grace.
It is note paper, but different from any I ever saw before.
"We can start early some Saturday morning, with enough lunch to last us all day, and walk to the other side of Upton Wood and back.
"What is it, Grace?" said Miss Thompson, who had been closely watching her.
I've known her for years and----" "Make him stop," appealed Nora to David and Reddy, "or I won't tell any of you a single thing." "I'll desist, merely to please the Irish lady, not because I'm afraid of you two long, slim persons," said Hippy, cleverly dodging both David and Reddy.
"Confidentially, Anne, do you ever hear from your father?" "Not very often," replied Anne.
I'd like to begin all over again," said Nora, as she rubbed her face with cold cream to take off her make-up.
3._] CONTENTS CHAPTER PAGE I.
They had no knowledge of the trials that their senior year was to bring them or how fully the truth of Grace's words was to be proved.
"In fact, all the prizes came from that useful and overworked place.
There was a faint snicker as Anne, Nora and Jessica raised three combs, wrapped in tissue paper, to their lips and began the "Merry Widow" waltz, with weird effect.
"You are all aware that each year the senior class gives a play, which they choose, manage and produce with no assistance save that given by Miss Tebbs," said the principal.
As soon as Reddy could free himself from the grasp of his school fellows, who would have borne him from the field in triumph if he had not stoutly resisted, he hurried to his friends, who showered him with congratulations.
She shan't leave this house," said the woman in a furious tone.
"One, two, three!" counted Grace, and the concert began.
She wrote him repeatedly, but he never answered her letters, and she was too proud to follow him.
"Then when you are free, we shall have something else to tell you.
Southard led the applause, and was ably seconded by Hippy, Reddy, David and Tom, who fairly wriggled with enthusiasm.
"I suppose theatrical people do undergo many hardships," said Grace, who, now that the subject had been opened, wanted to hear more of Anne's views of the stage.
Without a doubt an effort would be made to find the culprit, and if it were proven that she did not return to the study hall as soon as dismissed from French, she might be asked to account for it, and thus call down suspicion upon herself.
Eleanor Savell had not yet returned to school.
Assuring herself that everything was there, Grace piled them up in her arms and sped softly down the stairs, opened the door, and in a twinkling was down the drive and into the runabout.
"We can't find them," they cried in alarm, "but we told Miss Tebbs and she'll be here in a minute." "We didn't say a word to any one else," said Nora, "because they must be somewhere about, and there is no use in stirring up a lot of unnecessary excitement." "Wise little Nora," said Grace, patting her on the shoulder.
3 THE YOUNG ENGINEERS IN NEVADA; Or, Seeking Fortune on the Turn of a Pick.
Ignoring the four chums, she walked up to Miriam Nesbit.
She passed the morning in the various stores, lunched in town and went to a matinée in the afternoon.
"You heard it, too, didn't you Jessica?" "Oh, yes, girls, I intended telling you before this," replied Jessica.
True enough, the two girls stood on the corner waiting for the others to come up.
I used to know nearly all the girls in school, but ever so many new ones have crept in, and some of them have come here from quite a distance, on account of the excellence of our High School.
"Every one excepting Eleanor has been told," said Grace.
As she passed the city hall clock she drew a breath of relief.
"I certainly should like to see the good old chap." "Will there be plenty to eat?" asked Hippy.
Gray wishes you and Mr.
I'm awfully thirsty." Suiting the action to the words, Grace hurried toward the cottage.
"Have you made a thorough search for them in the other room?" "We've gone over every inch of the ground," exclaimed Jessica, "and we can't find a trace of them.
Would you care to understudy the part?" Eleanor was silent for a moment.
I heard him in New York City.
I didn't feel frightened at all, after what Grace had said about meeting David." "Eva and Marian didn't show any great amount of courage," said Nora, laughing.
The seniors, of course, will give their own play later." "How did you find out?" asked Anne.
Gray wishes to see us all at four o'clock this afternoon.
They would have plenty of time for their call without hurrying themselves.
"Do hurry," said Jessica, as they neared the judge's beautiful home.
"I am afraid so," replied Anne.
She is going up there this week with a couple of servants to open the bungalow and put it in readiness for eight girls who call themselves the Phi Sigma Tau, providing their fathers and mothers can spare them for a few weeks.
"Ruth Deane is a terror when she gets fairly started.
Miss Tebbs said that some of the costumes were moved over there after we left last night.
I have come to take Miss Mabel away with me.
I always could stand on one foot like a crane," announced Jessica, "and hopping is my specialty." There was an egg and spoon race, a walking match, an apple-eating contest, with the apples suspended by strings from the low branch of a tree, to be eaten without aid from the hands, and various other stunts of a similar nature.
I suppose she will stay away from the game merely because we are on the team.
"She must have yards of blue ribbon that she won at baby shows when but a mere infant." "Attention, boys and girls," cried Grace.
It's almost six o'clock." Eleanor chose Nevin's "Venetian Love Song," and Jessica again accompanied her.
"I just marked it because----" "You have the marking habit," finished Jessica.
She----" "Not that horrible, miserly Miss Brant who lives in that ugly yellow house on Elm Street?" interrupted Grace in a horrified tone.
That would be eight months, and at the end of that time she would have finished her sophomore year.
"It ended very sensationally for me." "I should say it did," replied David, smiling.
"Maybe the initiation was too much for her." "Oh, I don't know.
"Suppose we go on a walking expedition," said Nora.
Your mother grew uneasy when ten o'clock came, so she telephoned your friends, and on comparing notes you were found to be among the missing." "What a mix-up," laughed Grace.
As I had spent considerable time and research in getting the subject matter together, the destruction of the paper is particularly annoying.
"She took me from an orphan asylum two years ago.
The clang of the first bell broke in upon the chattering groups, and obedient to its summons, the girls moved slowly out of the locker-room and down the corridor, talking in subdued tones as they strolled toward the study hall.
Can't you tell me about it?" she coaxed, sitting down on the bench and slipping one arm around the shabby little figure.
In it are twenty-one speaking characters, besides numerous lords, pages and attendants.
You see, I still have a hankering for aëroplanes." "There wasn't any exhibition, after all," said David.
I am not a child and I understand my own business thoroughly.
Take good care of Mabel.
Here we are at Stillman's." Without waiting for a second invitation, the Phi Sigma Tau trooped joyfully into the drug store.
If it is, I don't think I shall stay long.
"What is it you want us to do?" "Well, it seems that some of your juniors are still in need of discipline.
He neglected his beautiful young wife, who, in spite of their frequent quarrels, loved him with a pure and disinterested affection.
Her features were small and regular, and her skin as creamy as the petal of a magnolia.
"Anne do you think that Eleanor could have written it?" she said slowly, as though reluctant to give voice to her suspicion.
As to her name, her aunt hates everything Italian, so she dropped the 'I' and made the name Savell." "My," said Nora with a sigh.
This spurred the junior team on to greater effort, and Miriam made a brilliant throw to basket that brought forth an ovation from the gallery.
Of course real stars do appear once in a while, who are too talented to be kept down.
Could Grace have known what Eleanor was engaged in at the moment she would have felt like exposing her without mercy.
The greater part of the furniture had been removed from the big living room and the floor had been crashed; while a string orchestra that made a specialty of playing for parties had been hired for the pleasure of those who cared to dance.
At the present moment I've a duty on hand that I don't in the least relish, and I want your august assistance.
Gray has refused over and over again to rent it.
"Yes, she will," said Grace, taking part in the discussion for the first time since it had touched on Eleanor.
Saturday turned out fair, and by nine o'clock the entire party were monopolizing the Harlowe's veranda.
"I'm terribly afraid of facing her," confided Jessica to Grace.
4 THE HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' TRAINING HIKE; Or, Dick & Co.
"I haven't see her to-night.
"I move we all take a half hour's rest and then go on," said David.
"O Grace, how could you do it?" said Anne, with a half sob.
This put her on the right track, but she was farther away from the picnic grounds than she had supposed, and when tired and breathless she at last reached them, it was only to find them deserted.
Then we'll swoop down upon them unawares." The avengers hurriedly concealed themselves at the side of the old house where they could not be seen by an approaching party.
When she had finished she handed the book back with an air of studied indifference she was far from feeling.
Please don't ask me what I am going to do.
David and Hippy are with him." "Well, well, well!" exclaimed Hippy as the girls approached.
"She is spared the ordeals of initiation.
"I spend most of my time there.
"We'll be in the front row to-morrow night," said Hippy, as the young folks trooped out to the car.
I was right when I said that Miss Brant would notify the police." "I hope she got a good scare," remarked Nora wickedly.
Then the seniors scored twice on fouls, tying the score.
It is something I was asked to sign." "And did you sign it?" asked Jessica.
"Borrow a gown for Anne, Miss Tebbs, for the first act," she cried.
Nora eagerly unfolded the paper and the girls crowded around, reading over her shoulder, Grace walking a little apart from them.
"Anne has a new accomplishment," said Grace.
THE JUNIORS FOREVER 163 XVII.
"She can spout poetry without trying." "Small credit is due me," said Anne, smiling.
"She told them that if they didn't stop it instantly, the juniors would pick them up bodily, carry them downstairs to the classroom and lock them in until the game was over." "How absurd!" exclaimed Grace.
But Grace was not the only person that Eleanor disliked.
There is some chance of her becoming great, too.
I shall have to give it a complete overhauling when I get it back to my workshop.
The other girls had not been so successful.
2 THE PONY RIDER BOYS IN TEXAS; Or, The Veiled Riddle of the Plains.
Her serves were as straight and accurate as a boy's, and she played with great spirit and agility.
"I nominate Miriam Nesbit for president," said Grace.
The first act was hardly half over.
She had eagerly awaited Anne's turn and was about to call Miss Tebbs's attention to Anne, just as that teacher had observed her.
No buyer of an ALTEMUS book is ever disappointed.
Her delivery of Touchstone's lines was delightful and she kept the audience in a gale of mirth whenever she appeared.
There were many hitches at first, but finally things settled down to smooth running order, and as the time for its presentation approached Miss Tebbs had good reason to feel jubilant.
You will at once discover that a given outlay of money will buy more of the ALTEMUS books than of those published by other houses.
To Eleanor's surprise, nothing was said of the matter that day.
It will be remembered how Grace Harlowe and her friends, Nora O'Malley and Jessica Bright, during their freshman year, became the firm friends of Anne Pierson, the brilliant young girl who won the freshman prize offered each year to the freshmen by Mrs.

"That is the sad part of my story," said Mrs.
They wore pins in the shape of skulls and cross bones, and went about making mysterious signs to each other whenever they met.
I'm awfully late, and haven't a minute to spare." "Why of course we will," said Grace.
If Eleanor really did believe the Phi Sigma Tau innocent, then perhaps this would be the opportunity for reconciliation.
I am going to put every girl on her honor, and I expect absolutely truthful answers.
She wasn't afraid of Miss Thompson.
"It's another lunatic," screamed Jessica.
But now he'll have to hustle if he gets through with High School this year, and he's wide awake to that fact." "Under those circumstances, Hippy is forgiven, but not you and Reddy!" said Grace severely.
A match had been arranged in which Grace and Miriam Nesbit were to play against Ruth Deane and Edna Wright, who was an indefatigable tennis player, and therefore figured frequently in tennis matches held in Oakdale.
"They were anything but happy.
They had been both kind and just, and if Eleanor defied them openly, then she would have to take the consequences.
Before one o'clock her guests had arrived.
I'd love to have her." Mr.
Then she suddenly threw both arms around Grace's neck and said, "I do love you, and I feel that some one cares about me at last." Then, like a flash, she darted across the square and was soon lost to Grace's view.
Do you recognize either the paper or the writing?" "No," replied Grace slowly, shaking her head.
"What an extraordinary girl!" said Jessica.
What are you girls doing out this way?" "Oh, we just came out to walk, because it was too nice to stay indoors," said Anne.
"My heart is with the juniors, and leave it to me not to land in any other class.
"It must be a hunter," panted Tom, "and he has heard the Elf's Horn." It was a hunter, and none other than old Jean.
The Phi Sigma Tau girls and a few of the grinds are really the only ones who behave lately." "It's largely due to Eleanor, I think," replied Anne.
"Let us forget what has happened and have just as good a time to-night as we can.
Directly after opening exercises the principal sent for her and asked the reason for her absence of the day before.
I told you she'd sulk if she couldn't be the leading lady." Grace glanced over toward Eleanor, who stood biting her lip, her hands clenched and her face set in angry lines.
Another gust of wind filled their eyes and nostrils with fine dust.
The cheers were given with a will, and after shaking hands with the judge, the girls said good-bye.
Gray wants us to be nice to Eleanor for a number of reasons, and, of course, we wish to please her.
If she had not shown such exceptional talent, 'Rosalind' would have certainly fallen to Miss Savell or yourself.
"Perhaps she would listen to us." "I don't believe so," replied Grace.
As her mother was unable to send her away to school, she had done clerical work for the only lawyer in the home town for the previous two years, studying between whiles.
"Certainly, my child," said Miss Tebbs, "but remember time is precious.
A few girls were seen to shake their heads dubiously, and a number of those termed "grinds" were not interviewed.
Has she lived with you long?" "That's none of your business," snapped Miss Brant.
Directly after the chums had hurried out of the hall to meet the boys, Miss Tebbs had decided that opening the dressing room on the other side of the stage would relieve the congestion and insure a better chance for all to dress.
"It is Mademoiselle Grace and her friends," cried the old man with delight.
The whole forest seemed suddenly astir.
"Oh, yes, I see her.
Professor La Roche, irritated to the point of frenzy, ordered her from his class, with instructions to report herself to Miss Thompson.
"Old English letters of gold on a dull-green enamel background.
On they stumbled, but suddenly came to grief, for the four in front fell headlong over a tree that had been blown across the path, and the other five hearing their cries of warning too late, followed after.
You took her from the orphanage on trial, exactly as you might hire a servant.
"Only the book people are all kings and queens, but this is even better because the heroine is actually Irish." There was a general laugh over Nora's remark in which Mrs.
It is hard to believe one of my girls guilty, yet it is not probable that any one outside could be responsible.
"I don't believe the last of June will ever come." The morning after commencement, eight highly excited girls gathered on the Harlowe's veranda.
I have finished my lunch.
"Contrary, 'no.'" The only "no" was from Miriam.
"The Nihilist's Daughter" was scheduled for Thursday afternoon, and Eleanor decided to go.
The majority, however, appeared to be highly delighted over what they heard, one group standing near one of the windows, of which Eleanor was the center, laughed so loudly that they were sent to their seats.
I worked there all through vacation last summer, and she took every cent of my wages.
"Well, well!" he exclaimed, smiling at the circle of girls.
One, two, three, walk." Eight highly excited boys and girls accompanied by Miss Edith O'Malley, hustled down the steps, waving good-bye to Mrs.
I didn't wear my watch to-night because I didn't want to risk losing it." "It's almost half past seven," said Jessica.
The girl who composed and wrote that agreement will now rise and explain herself." Without hesitating, Eleanor rose and regarded the principal with an insolent smile.
IRVING HANCOCK= These books breathe the life and spirit of the United States Army of to-day, and the life, just as it is, is described by a master pen.
Oakdale was very proud of her High School boys and girls, and enjoyed seeing them happy.
Taking the book from her, he turned to the part where Touchstone, quaintly humorous, holds forth upon "the lie seven times removed." "Read this," he said briefly, holding out the book to Nora.
Before she had finished Chief Burroughs had begun to act.
Grace, after losing the hundred-yard dash, laughingly refused to enter the other contests.
4 UNCLE SAM'S BOYS IN THE PHILIPPINES; Or, Following the Flag Against the Moros.
"You are not running this production." "I have no time to waste in arguing the matter," returned Grace with admirable self-control.
Glancing quickly down at her friend to ascertain the cause of Anne's sudden agitation, Grace saw her friend's eyes following the figure of a tall, distinguished-looking man who was just disappearing down the corridor leading to the gymnasium.
I enclose a statement from the matron to this effect.
It's a wonder she'd condescend to come and watch her mortal enemies play." "I suppose she hopes we'll lose," said Marian Barber.
Come on up to my house, and we'll make fudge and have things to eat." "I have my car here," said David.
"Then you'll feel more indignant and can help my cause along all the better.
1 THE HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' CANOE CLUB; Or, Dick & Co.'s Rivals on Lake Pleasant.
I wonder how he and Hippy will enjoy chaperoning thirteen girls?" "I won't have the slightest chance to talk to Hippy," grumbled Nora, "and he has neglected us shamefully of late, too." "Never mind, you can have him all to yourself at my party," consoled Grace.
She is practically born, bred and brought up in the theatre.
Grace forgot everything but the fact that she desired the victory.
A brief season of introduction followed, then Grace distributed blue and white rosettes with long streamers that she had made for the occasion, to each member of the party.
It seemed as though Eleanor's very soul had entered into the violin.
"She is hunting her lost chick, as usual." With merry laugh and jest the girls prepared for the street.
Unless a severe example is made of the offenders, the standard of the school will be lowered.
1 THE SUBMARINE BOYS ON DUTY; Or, Life on a Diving Torpedo Boat.
"What do you suppose she's up to now?" "Oh, never mind her," said Nora impatiently.
What she had said evidently impressed them.
Miss Thompson had taken their names, but had not stated their punishment and it was certain that they would be made to feel the full weight of her displeasure.
* * * * * To return to those youthful transgressors.
Crowding them hastily into the bottom of the machine, she slipped on her coat, made ready her runabout and drove down the street like the wind, not lessening her speed until she reached the drive at "Heartsease." * * * * * The young people passed a merry hour at Nora's, indulging in one of their old-time frolics, that only lacked Tom Gray's presence to make the original octette complete.
Don't think I'm unfeeling; but it is impossible for me to care for him, even though he is my father." "I understand," said David sympathetically.
"We do seem to be getting awfully serious and settled of late," replied Anne.
"The eternal labeler," said Nora, with her ever-ready giggle, as she watched Anne.
"You and Grace go to the door, while Anne and I stay here with our victims.
There were strange sounds from every direction.
"I have engaged a beautiful bunch of green onions from the truck florist, Reddy has put all his money into carrots of a nice lively color, the exact shade of his hair, while I have advised Davy here to invest in turnips.
Several times they caught sight of a folded paper being stealthily passed from one desk to another, but as to its contents they had no idea, as it was not handed to any one of them.
It was a sudden attack of enthusiasm.
Anne has already been there.
"There were so many different kinds of noises I couldn't distinguish it." "There was one noise that started that was promptly hushed," said Anne.
"She must be somewhere about, for----" "There she goes now," exclaimed Nora, who stood in the door, looking out on the stage, "and she has her hat and coat on.
She looks as haughty as ever.
Going back to the dressing room, she rapped sharply on the door.
Even the furniture has not been changed.
Besides, Miss Thompson is going to speak." The principal held up her hand for silence and the groups of girls engaged in subdued conversation ceased talking and turned their attention toward her.
"How did Judge Putnam know about the Phi Sigma Tau; even to its name?" asked Marian Barber curiously.
"But all we can do is to try harder than ever to make things go smoothly.
"I hate the teachers, and I hate Miss Thompson most of all.
"I believe we all have the same place in mind," laughed Grace.
"I suppose she thinks that hurts me.
"They'll do anything you tell them," whispered Nora.
Are you sure they're juniors?" "The two I heard talking are juniors.
As Grace sleepily prepared for bed, she felt a little thrill of pride at the success of her party, and her only regret was the fact that of all those invited, Eleanor was the only one who had refused to be present.
Gray stood in the wide hall with hands outstretched in welcome.
Don't you know you might frighten some timid person terribly?" "Initiation," said the youth, with a grin, rising on his elbow and looking as though he would like to make a sudden break for liberty.
I want you to see where I live, almost entirely, when in the house." The girls followed her up the broad staircase and down the hall.
Never give her a chance to take advantage of you in any way, for she is determined to make mischief.
She forgot her lines and had to be prompted.
"It looks as though Nora had made an impression, doesn't it!" whispered Jessica to Grace, who was about to reply when Mr.
By dint of questioning, Grace had discovered that she lived in a shabby little room in the suburbs, never went anywhere and did anything honest in the way of earning money that she could find to do.

But she is reckless, self-willed, defiant of public opinion and exceedingly impulsive.
Bring your girls along and I'll do my best to give them a good time, although I'm generally anything but a success with new girls.
If she could slip out that way, she could make a run for the picnic grounds, but she dared not try to pass the two men who had just appeared.
"And my new howl was a success, too." "Glad to know that," said Grace.
"Not yet," said Nora, "but never fear, the night is yet young." "Where is Eleanor Savell?" asked Grace, noticing for the first time that Eleanor was not present.
Grace sighed a little over the rebuff, and then completely forgot her trouble as she donned the new gown that had just come from the dressmaker.
I am very sorry, but it looks as though Miss Savell will have to play Rosalind after all, and she must be notified at once." The three chums turned to Anne, who was biting her lip and trying hard to keep back her tears.
The stories are wonderfully entertaining, and they are at the same time sound and wholesome.
We might as well live up to the reputation Eleanor has thrust upon us.
I will wait for a minute while you choose your song.
Once outside the gate, the chums unconsciously headed in the same direction.
7 THE MOTOR BOAT CLUB ON THE GREAT LAKES; Or, The Flying Dutchman of the Big Fresh Water.
Indeed, the sides were so evenly matched that junior excitement rose high and numerous boxes of Huyler's were wagered against the result.
My sister would be glad to go with us, so that will settle the matter of having an older person along.
"I'll walk to Oakdale," she said, with a determined nod of her head.
I certainly didn't vote for her." "Nor I," responded Jessica.
Oh, I must get out of here, but I won't try to go until I find out whose house they're going to rob." The men talked on, but, listen as she might, Grace could get no clue.
Southard particularly commended her work.
Her musical voice vibrated with expression and the mock-serious bantering tones in which she delivered Rosalind's witty speeches caused Mr.
Jessica, whose courage had fled, would have been among the latter if Nora had not seized her firmly by the arm as she prepared to flee and marched her over with the rest of the Phi Sigma Tau.
I'm very glad to know you, Miss Allison, but I am sorry to find you so unhappy.
Tom's trained eye spied a wasp's nest hanging from a limb.
I shall never forget the way he played one of Liszt's 'Hungarian Rhapsodies.' I must caution you, girls, never to mention Eleanor's father to her.
"So Miss Tebbs thinks I ought to be satisfied with 'Celia,'" she muttered.
If you're not there in three minutes, I'll put Hippy on your trail." Closing the door, Grace walked slowly toward the entrance.

"Is it school that makes you so?

But a day of reckoning was at hand, for just before the close of vacation Miss Thompson chanced to call at Mrs.
Only I don't expect to ever be a very useful one.
Have you ever belonged to a secret society?" "Never," replied Eleanor.
"Of course not, goose," replied Grace.
THE END HENRY ALTEMUS COMPANY'S CATALOGUE OF The Best and Least Expensive Books for Real Boys and Girls Really good and new stories for boys and girls are not plentiful.
The three girls made a rush for her.
"Don't you remember, I labeled them and you laughed at me for doing so?" "Of course we do," said Nora, making a dive for the corner where Anne had piled her costumes the previous night.
Bright drew Jessica to his side.
Passersby glanced curiously at the hatless, shabby young girl, as she walked between Grace and Jessica, clinging to their hands as though expecting every minute to be snatched from them.
IRVING HANCOCK= The reading boy will be a voter within a few years; these books are bound to make him think, and when he casts his vote he will do it more intelligently for having read these volumes.
When the gong sounded dismissal, about sixty girls with dramatic aspirations made for the library.
A WOULD-BE "LARK" 150 XVI.
His eyes rested a shade longer on Eleanor.
"Good gracious," exclaimed Julia Crosby.
She gave Grace one long, agonized look, then dropped her head on her arm and sobbed harder than ever.
"Why don't you answer me, little girls?" asked Julia.
"I love the woods, too," said Grace, "almost enough to wish I were a gypsy." On down the shady wood road they traveled, sometimes stopping to watch a squirrel or a chipmunk or to knock down a few burrs from the chestnut trees they occasionally found along the way.

Then help of some sort would surely come.
But I must go or I shall be late.

"They seem possessed with imps.
Grace, who was directly behind her, saw both the look and the expression on the teacher's face.
"Miriam and I are going up under the trees and read Browning." "The idea of going to a picnic and reading!" exclaimed Jessica.
It had all seemed a huge joke when they planned it, but there was nothing funny about it now.
The costumes had for the most part been on hand, as the senior class of five years previous had given the same play and bequeathed their paraphernalia to those who should come after.
MEARS= The author has made of these volumes a series of romances with scenes laid in the iron and steel world.
"My dear little girl," he said, taking her hand, "she can't touch you.
The party had gone back to town without her.
She had obtained the information she sought.
She had won the repeated applause of the group of teachers who had been invited to witness this trial performance.
Southard hurriedly departed, leaving his audience devoured with curiosity as to the chosen ones.
We didn't give the ball, so it's up to us to go picnicking." "That's a fine suggestion, Nora," said Jessica.
I am not particularly surprised at this, however.
Gray is in it, too.
That's why she was so hateful." "So that's the famous Eleanor?" said Tom Gray in a low tone to Grace.
It was precisely the same style of paper on which Eleanor Savell had declined her Thanksgiving invitation.
She was about to tell the principal that she was not used to being addressed in that tone, but the words would not come.
"O girls!" exclaimed Eva Allen from the open door, in which she had been standing looking up at the gallery.
"I am not easily frightened." "Very well," replied Grace, looking steadily at her enemy.
"It's a shame to spoil it," replied David, "but I am afraid your Elf's Horn and Jean's helloing were just a coincidence." "Coincidence or not," replied Tom good-naturedly, "my faith in the fairy horn is now unshakable.
Gray occupying the seat of honor at the head of one, and Miss Thompson, who was a favorite at High School parties, the other.
"That has a dandy swing to it." Grace hummed a few bars.
"Why, how did you know her name?" cried Eleanor, apparently mystified.
"Come with us, dear," said Anne to Grace, who stood looking dreamily toward a patch of woods to the left.
"Please excuse me for breaking in upon you, but I saw you from afar, and you looked awfully good to me." Her clear enunciation made the slang phrase sound like the purest English.
"I wonder at her consenting to play against us.
"Now, you just take it easy and rest until your father comes.
Cloth, Illustrated Price, per Volume, 50c.
They were made to dip their hands in water charged with electricity, caress a mechanical rubber snake that wriggled realistically, drink a cup of boneset tea apiece, and were directed finally to bare their arms for the branding of the letters of the society.
Anne still stood talking with Mr.
I found your stuff and some time I'll tell you where, but not now." The play progressed with remarkable smoothness, and the various actors received unstinted applause from the audience, but from first to last Anne was the star.
Gray's house party, the winter picnic in Upton Wood, and Anne Pierson's struggles to escape her unworthy father all contributed toward making the story stand out in the reader's mind.
"All ready, let her go," was the chorus, and the machine whizzed down the street.
"Don't pay any attention to her.
Reddy is horribly jealous of her.

"She fairly snarled at us the other day, when we were coming from school, because she said we were taking up the whole sidewalk.
You know I've lived most of my life abroad.
"I have played with her and she is a wonder." It was with considerable surprise and some misgiving that Grace discovered that Eleanor was to play.
3 THE AUTOMOBILE GIRLS ALONG THE HUDSON; Or, Fighting Fire in Sleepy Hollow.
"I'm wid yer, Jim," answered another voice in correspondingly savage tones.
"Where are Anne and Jessica to-day?" asked Eva Allen.
Several girls approached Eleanor, but she fairly ran from them and hurried out of the gymnasium after Miss Tebbs with Edna Wright and Daisy Culver at her heels.
"Now sit you down, I pray, for presently I have a tale to tell." Having conducted Mr.
"What I want is the truth about the costumes and you must answer me." "'Must,'" repeated Eleanor, raising her eyebrows.
"I do so want a part, if only a little one." "You'll be chosen for Rosalind, see if you aren't," predicted Grace.
"As soon as you find out about Miss Brant's claim, we shall take the matter to Jessica's father, who is a lawyer.
"What a shame!" cried Marian Barber.
I won't dare aspire to a part now, and I had designs on the part of Phebe." "Don't be a goose," said Nora.
Gray that I would help you to like High School life.
When Miss Nevin confronted her niece with the deception Eleanor had practised upon her, a stormy scene had followed, and Eleanor had accused Grace Harlowe of telling tales to Mrs.
As for the persons who told you about our plan, words cannot express my contempt for them, and right here I accuse Grace Harlowe and her sorority of getting the information from Mabel Allison yesterday and carrying it to you.
I swear it," panted Hippy.
"I have not asked you to enact a mob scene." Under cover of the confusion, Grace and her three friends slipped out of the library.
Hurry, for every second is precious." "I can't get them," wailed Eleanor.
Best of all, the principal would never find out who did it, for Eleanor vowed never to admit her guilt.
She had decided to reveal that to no one.
On the contrary, she experienced a wicked satisfaction, and smiled to herself as she pictured Miss Thompson's consternation when the latter should discover her loss.
It was eight o'clock when the storm had abated sufficiently to allow them to sally forth, and in a short time they were in Oakdale.
This closed the nominations for president, and the matter when put to vote resulted in Grace's election by a majority of ten votes over Miriam, Eleanor having received only five.
She was a trifle taller than Grace and beautifully straight and slender.
Just trust me and wait.
Grace nodded to her, but her salutation met with a chilly stare.
Gray had planned a party for us, but when we told her what we were about to do, she gave up her party and agreed to go to mine instead, on condition that Anne's family, plus Anne's two guests, should have dinner with her." "Bless her dear heart," said David, "she is always thinking of the pleasure of others.
"Anne is a charter member, if you please," laughed Grace.
"You shall not leave this room until you have apologized to the girls whom you have unjustly accused and to me.
I remember your work at the try-out," said Mr.
Directly after cutting Grace Harlowe, she had turned her runabout into Main Street, where a billboard had caught her eye, displaying in glaring red and blue lettering the fact that the "Peerless Dramatic Company" would open a week's engagement in Oakdale with daily matinées.
Miss Thompson said my work was good, and that if I were ambitious she would put me in the senior class, but I held out for the juniors and finally got my own way.
The few words of their conversation proved them to be lawless.
The plan is to charge fifty cents a piece for the tickets and to give each girl a certain number of them to sell.
Sure enough, Anne's missing costumes were lying in a neat heap on the floor.
Her change of voice from Rosalind to Orlando was wholly delightful, and so charmingly did she depict both characters that when she ended with Orlando's exit she received a little ovation from the listening girls, in which Mr.
"Oh, I don't know just what I want to say, only let's proceed slowly with her, then we'll never have anything to regret." "Come on, girls," said Jessica impatiently.
"He fell violently in love with Edith, who had her mother's beautiful blue eyes and the combination of white skin and black hair that go to make an Irish beauty.
Miss Tebbs stood by with a pencil and pad.
He rose, and, tucking his daughter's arm in his, walked out to the sitting room, where the Phi Sigma Tau eagerly awaited him.
After the reel, the young folks romped through "Paul Jones," and then the party broke up, all declaring that never before had they had quite such a good time.
CHAPTER IV GRACE MAKES A DISCOVERY The Monday after the walking expedition, Grace Harlowe set out for school full of an idea that had been revolving in her busy brain for weeks.
I shall use it again if I ever need to." Before a blazing fire kindled by Jean in the big fireplace, the whole party dried themselves.
4 DAVE DARRIN'S FOURTH YEAR AT ANNAPOLIS; Or, Headed for Graduation and the Big Cruise.
Well supplied with Oakdale colors, they set out for the football grounds, where an immense crowd of people had gathered to see the big game of the season.
Some time ago Miss Tebbs suggested that as we need money for special books in the library which our yearly appropriation does not cover, we might present a Shakespearian play with good effect, choosing the cast from the freshman, sophomore and junior classes.
Her portrayal of Rosalind left little to be desired.
"What are you going to do about to-night--and everything?" asked Eleanor.
Five studies aren't any harder for you than four for us." "Thank the lady prettily for her high opinion of your ability, Anne," said Grace, laughing.
If she knew he was the great Savelli, she would rush off and join him to-morrow, she is so impulsive.
She wisely decided to ignore it, but stored it up in her memory for future reference.
Her eyes wandered toward where Eleanor sat, looking bored and indifferent, and then she looked toward Grace, whose steady gray eyes were fixed on the principal's face with respectful attention.
"I was only jesting when I spoke about your love for the stage.
"I ought to go straight home," demurred Anne Pierson, "but I'll put pleasure before duty and stay with the crowd." "What about you, Jessica?" asked Grace.
Gray?" queried Nora eagerly, "and is little Eleanor living?" "It was sixteen years ago, my dear," replied Mrs.
As Miss Tebbs has charge of the situation, I yield the floor to her.
Here, sit down in this nice, easy chair, while we take turns telling you just how young you are." "It is due to my adopted children that I am not a cross, crotchety, complaining old woman," said Mrs.
It is the claim of the artistic temperament." "Please play once more," begged Nora.
"The fun is all spoiled now, and everyone will know about it before school begins to-morrow." "Daisy, how can you say so?" exclaimed Grace, who, fearing a scene with Eleanor, had hitherto remained silent.
I'll not fail." Slipping into her long coat and seizing her fur hat, Grace made for the street, stopping for an instant to take the key from Eleanor, who stood waiting at the door.
"I know," she said at last.
After a rousing Thanksgiving dinner, in which the inevitable turkey, with all its toothsome accompaniments, played a prominent part, the girls retired to Grace's room for a final adjustment of hair and a last survey in the mirror before going to the game.
"You poor, little thing!" she cried.
"What a beautiful room!" exclaimed Grace, looking about her with delight.
Like herself, there were plenty of girls in school to whom mischief did not appeal, but Eleanor's beauty, wealth and fascinating personality were found to dazzle some of the girls, who would follow her about like sheep, and it was over these girls that Grace felt worried.
"But are you willing to burden yourselves with some extra girls?
They do not belong among the number who trail tamely after you, either.
They were spending a most uncomfortable half hour with Miss Thompson.
"I don't believe Grace is guilty, at any rate," thought Miss Thompson; then she addressed the assembled girls.
The principal actors in the play had been well remembered by friends, and the dressing rooms looked like a florist's shop.
The junior fans howled joyfully at the good work of their team.
5 THE SUBMARINE BOYS' LIGHTNING CRUISE; Or, The Young Kings of the Deep.
They're all good." "Eleanor will be surprised to see us," remarked Grace, as she rang the bell.
"Good night, James." "Good night," replied the youth.
"I move that we drop our books at my house and go for a walk." "I'm willing to drop my books anywhere and never see them again," grumbled Nora O'Malley, who was not fond of study.
3 THE BATTLESHIP BOYS IN FOREIGN SERVICE; Or, Earning New Ratings in European Seas.
"It was abominable," said Eva Allen.
You aren't going to back out, are you, and leave me without proper support?" "Of course not," laughed Grace.
Besides, you have no right to block a public highway, as you did.
"It does seem good to be back, even though we have had such a perfectly glorious summer," said Jessica Bright.
With a bound she reached the middle of the road, seized Mabel and dragged her back just as the runabout passed over the place where she had fallen.
"As Edith grew older, she developed a decided talent for music, and when she was fifteen Margaret decided to take her abroad and allow her to enter one of the great conservatories of Europe.
Her aunt has spoiled her, and realizes too late the damage she has done by having allowed her to grow up on the continent.
School was dismissed as usual, and the girls went out without dreaming that on the morrow they would all be placed under suspicion until the person guilty of the outrage was found.
"I wonder if they ran all the way home." "There they are ahead of us," said Anne.
IRVING HANCOCK= In this series of bright, crisp books a new note has been struck.

She must have wanted to play Rosalind herself.
"Eleanor is taller than Anne.

Jessica, will you ask your father if he will be at liberty for a few minutes this evening?" "Certainly," replied Jessica.
They both had too much of the artistic temperament to live peaceably.
"What does ail some of our class?" she exclaimed to Anne and Nora one day as they left the school building.
There he is talking with Miss Tebbs now." The girls entered the gymnasium to find there nearly all of those who had attended the first meeting in the library increased by about a score of girls who had decided at the last minute to try for parts.
We are to look after girls who have no one to make things pleasant or happy for them.
By the way, Nora, what was that news of yours that you were so mysterious about this afternoon?" "Just this," replied Nora.
You know she hates me, and will disgrace me in the eyes of the girls." "And you richly deserve it, Eleanor," replied Grace, "but if you produce Anne's costumes at once, I'll agree to say nothing.
Grace lost no time in putting her plan into action.
There was a sound of rending cloth as the apparition bounded forward, then it caught its spectre toe on a tuft of long grass and fell forward with a decidedly human thud.
I was, therefore, astonished to learn that a number of girls, regardless of rules, have taken matters into their own hands and have decided to absent themselves from school to-morrow in order to attend the matinée to be given in the theatre.

"I'm going to learn just as much as I can while I have the chance." "Well," said Jessica, "you're different.
By the time they had picked themselves up the storm had grown so furious that they could only press miserably together and wait for it to pass.
"Why, of course not," said Grace promptly, recovering in a measure from her first surprise.
"Some one else will be sure to get that.
"Let's charge them in a body." With a bound she reached the drive, closely followed by the other girls.
But don't dare to fail me." "Thank you, Miss Tebbs.
As she turned out of High School Street she heard a familiar call, and, glancing up the street, saw her three chums waiting for her on the corner.
"Give me your hat and coat, dear.
"You know that I should like to.
"I wanted her to play Rosalind, and I knew she could do it.
Why, do you know that there are quite a number of girls attending High School who come from other places, and who have to spend the holidays at their boarding houses without any fun at all?
"How are the Phi Sigma Taus to-day?" she asked.
You may all sing the first verse and the chorus of any song you know, only be sure that you don't choose the same song, and don't stop until you have finished," directed Grace.
Her aunt was here yesterday, and we had a long talk regarding her.
So, you see, there is no hope for me." She spread out both hands in a deprecating manner and shrugged her shoulders exactly as a French woman might have done.
6 THE MOTOR BOAT CLUB AT THE GOLDEN GATE; Or, A Thrilling Capture in the Great Fog.
The party that evening was to be a strictly informal affair.
"Wait and see," replied Nora, with a grin of delight.
The closing line of the Epilogue had been spoken by Rosalind, and she had taken five curtain calls and retired with her arms full of flowers.
"'This is getting curiouser and curiouser.'" The four girls laughed merrily.
2 THE SUBMARINE BOYS' TRIAL TRIP; Or, "Making Good" as Young Experts.
Just after I had finished my supper and was putting on my wraps a boy came to the door with this note." Anne went over to where her coat hung and took out an envelope.
Grace had received a note from Judge Putnam requesting that the Phi Sigma Tau call upon him at ten o'clock that morning.
I believe every girl in Oakdale High School knows you.
Summoning three special policemen, he narrated briefly what he had just heard, and five minutes later Grace had the satisfaction of knowing that, fully armed, they were well on their way to the Putnam estate.
In a moment the main corridor was filled with girls from the various classrooms, and, joining them, Eleanor entered the study hall without reporting her dismissal from French class.
I am to have three; I found another yesterday.
Wingate and presented by a notable cast, would be the next offering.
I must go this minute.
As for Hippy, Nora says that he is studying night and day, and that he is actually wearing himself away by burning midnight oil." "Yes, Hippy is studying some this year," replied David.
Then Rosalind took two calls and bowed herself into the wings and straight into Grace's arms.
The only other girl proposed being one who was not particularly popular in the class.
"'Heartsease'?" cried the girls in chorus.
She opened it, read it through, and an expression of such intense scorn passed over her face that Nora, who sat near her and who was covertly watching her, knew at once that Grace's flag of truce had been trampled in the dust.
"It is a story of real life, my child, but I'll begin it like a fairy tale if you wish it." "Oh, please begin at once," said Grace, who, at eighteen, was as fond of a story as she had been at six.
"No boys allowed there, sir, she said." "That settles it," sighed David.
"She called on mother yesterday afternoon, and, for a wonder, I was at home.
People are beginning to arrive." "Wait a minute," said Jessica.
"Of what use is it to hold a meeting, if I tell you all the business beforehand?" "All right," said Nora, "you keep your secrets and I'll keep mine." "What have you heard that's new?" asked Grace.
She always has them when an idea hits her.
Straight down the line he went, sometimes stopping a girl at her third or fourth line, rarely allowing them to read farther than the eleventh or twelfth.
I was on the purchasing committee." "I shall enter the one-legged race.
Which one of them was guilty?
"I see you will be valuable additions to the society." The girls were then put through a series of ridiculous tests that the four chums had devised.
We are to dine with her and spend the evening, and the boys are invited for the evening, too.
Julia Crosby and Grace took turns sprinting around the gymnasium three times in succession, while Miriam Nesbit timed them, Grace finishing just two seconds ahead of Julia.
To show fear or reluctance in obeying the demands made upon one, was to prove one's self unworthy of membership in the Phi Sigma Tau.
I know Miss Brant will be very angry.
He is very clever at that sort of thing." "Let's have a monogram," exclaimed Grace.
I hate responsibility of any sort." "Perhaps you will feel differently about school after a while," said Anne quietly.
What shall I play?" "Do you know the 'Peer Gynt' suite?" asked Grace.
Who shall I say is here?" "Say to Miss Savell that Grace Harlowe and her friends would like to see her." The maid soon reappeared and led the girls down the wide, old-fashioned hall, and, somewhat to their surprise, ushered them into the dining room, where they beheld Eleanor, arrayed in a dainty white house gown, dining alone.
I know too well what would happen if you boys traced us to our lair.
"She's so angry she can't see straight.
Foremost among them was Eleanor.
Gray loomed up before her.
Miriam Nesbit can play Orlando as well as I, and makes a more striking appearance at that." "I don't agree with you, Grace, for you were an ideal 'Orlando,'" replied Miss Tebbs.
"You'll have to have better excuses than football and experiments." "I'll tell you what we'll do to square ourselves," said David, smiling.
"She's going to take me out of school.
Now we'd better dodge around the corner and keep out of sight until they get here.
However, you have imposed upon her for the last time, for she shall not spend another hour under your roof." "You touch her if you dare.
The one downstairs in the drawing room is all right, but I like to have this one handy, so that I can play whenever the spirit moves me.
"I am sure we like you, just as you are," said Eva Allen warmly.
I am a lawyer, Miss Brant, and I have positive proof that this child is not bound to you in any way.
A public apology was the last thing that either she or her friends desired.
"How do you know?" was the question.
1 THE SQUARE DOLLAR BOYS WAKE UP; Or, Fighting the Trolley Franchise Steal.
Only I can't play Orlando.
"It would be useless for you to attempt to be spokesman in this matter, because you are a new girl in High School and know nothing of past class matters except from hearsay.
I am certain of making a better appearance." "What you say about appearance is quite true, Miss Savell," replied Miss Tebbs frankly.
Then Nora read aloud: "TO THE PHI SIGMA TAU: "Your kind appreciation of my conduct in the matter of apology is really remarkable, coupled with the fact that your inability to refrain from discussing my personal affairs with Mrs.
"I wonder what school will bring us this year?" mused Nora O'Malley, as she retied her bow for the fifth time before the mirror and critically surveyed the final effect.

2 THE IRON BOYS AS FOREMEN; Or, Heading the Diamond Drill Shift.
She had one child, a baby girl, named Eleanor, who was the sole comfort of the heartbroken mother." At this juncture Anne and Grace exchanged significant glances.
I asked her what she meant, and she said that she and Rose Lynton and Daisy Culver had been invited out to Eleanor's to-night for the purpose of forming a very select club of their own.
The first day of school amounted to really nothing further than being assigned to one's seat and getting used to the idea of school again.
"I cannot pass lightly over such a piece of wanton destruction.
"Hurrah!" His example was quickly followed and the noise of the cheering brought people to their doors to see what the excitement was about.
Do you think they will care to go?" "Oh-h-h-h!
She is really very charming, although her ideas about punctuality and school rules are somewhat hazy as yet.
"We haven't settled on that fourth subject yet," interposed Nora.
Without an instant's hesitation Grace made for the bench.
Perhaps I can be of some service to you.
This was one of the oldest and mildest forms of initiation, but Nora had insisted upon it, and giggled violently as the four girls prepared for a long leap.
Please make it a point to be on hand." "Good-bye, Grace," chorused her friends, and went on down the street discussing the probable fate of the would-be truants.
Please, please don't ask me." "Very well," responded the principal in a tone of cold dismissal, turning to her desk.
"I feel sure that she didn't, and I am just as sure that she won't get back until she does." "We shall manage to exist if she doesn't," said Jessica dryly.
She determined that the holidays that year should not find them without friends and cheer.
"Why that's a good twelve miles and----" "I know," interrupted Grace, then was silent, for the chief had begun talking to the livery.
"Then that settles it," cried Grace.
"Perhaps she won't come back to school next year, she is so changeable," said Jessica hopefully.
Want to come?" "Not I," laughed Anne.
Isn't there a telephone in the judge's house?
2 THE SQUARE DOLLAR BOYS SMASH THE RING; Or, In the Lists Against the Crooked Land Deal.
Did you not hear what he said?" "Oh, yes; I heard him complimenting her," replied Eleanor complacently, "but I feel sure that I can do more with it than she can.
Something in the elder woman's quiet, resolute face as she sat writing checked the wilful girl, and though she felt deeply incensed at the reprimand, she managed to control herself and walked out of the office with her head held high, vowing to herself that Miss Thompson should pay for what Eleanor termed "her insolence." All morning she sulked through her classes, and before closing time had managed to incur the displeasure of every teacher to whom she recited.
She always was a wide awake youngster.
"Her name is very familiar to me." "What class are you girls in?" said Eleanor, abruptly changing the subject.
"O you Titian-haired star!" cried Hippy, clasping his hands in mock admiration.
By the last week in January, the ordeal was past.
"Thank goodness, none of us were concerned in that affair," she told the members of her basketball team at recess.
Eleanor, after groping along one side of the room for a corner, was the first to find one, and sank with a sigh of relief upon the pile of cushions.
Miss Nevin called on Mrs.
Edna Wright must have told her all about last year." Her reflections were cut short, for one of the girls glanced up from her digging with a sudden exclamation which drew all eyes toward Julia and her party.
Anne heard you the other night, and told us about it." "I love the violin better than the piano, but it sounds better with a piano accompaniment.
A moment more and Mabel Allison began to speak in a plaintive little voice that went straight to Grace's heart: "You are Grace Harlowe.
For a second, Eleanor stood regarding Miss Thompson with angry eyes.
"I asked Jessica to-day, and she said that they didn't want to know how we intended to play, for then they could wax enthusiastic and make a great deal more noise.
THE ANONYMOUS LETTER 199 XXI.
"Here it is," said Grace, handing Nora the note.
Their sorority enthusiasm had so completely run away with them that they had even neglected basketball until now.
"I'm perpetually broke." "So am I," said Jessica.
"You bad boy!" exclaimed Grace.
Gray to release me from my promise." CHAPTER XVIII THE PLAY'S THE THING Excitement ran high in the three lower classes one morning in early February when Miss Thompson requested that those interested in the production of a Shakespearian play go to the library directly after school, there to discuss the situation.
I know I said that once before, and I broke my word.
The glare from the neighboring light revealed her tear-swollen eyes and quivering lips.
It's almost time for the curtain," she said to Miss Tebbs.
"We missed you at school to-day." "Oh, no," replied Eleanor serenely.
Aside from this conversation they had exchanged no words, and Eleanor therefore entered school that morning still believing the Phi Sigma Tau to be at the bottom of her misfortune.
As soon as a girl from any of the three lower classes appeared she was approached by some of the former and a great deal of whispering and subdued laughter went on.
Gray to send for you at the eleventh hour," said Grace in a puzzled tone.
Even Mabel had refused to sign.
Here she paused, and hearing no disturbance from inside, she continued her flight.
Southard to smile and nod approvingly as she gave full value to the immortal lines.
Bright!" cried Grace, clasping her hands delightedly, "will you, truly?
We will wait for you.
We thought we could learn to know her better, and she would eventually become a good comrade." "It sounds ridiculous to talk about helping a clever girl like Eleanor, but from her conversation to-night you can see that she needs some wholesome advice occasionally," said Nora bluntly.
"We are a notch higher, too.
"Our sorority has made us fast friends, loyal to each other, through good and evil report," she continued.
"I have a tale to tell." "Out with it!" was the cry, and the girls surrounded Grace, who began with her meeting with David, and ended with the story of Mabel Allison.
"The boys' crack team couldn't have played a better game," he said solemnly, and the girls knew that he could pay them no higher compliment, for this team was considered invincible by the High School boys.
Once the girls were outside the gate, Marian Barber broke out with: "What a queer girl that Eleanor Savell is.
During the first rehearsals Grace, secretly fearing an outbreak on Eleanor's part, had been on the alert, but as rehearsals progressed and Eleanor kept strictly to herself, Grace relaxed her vigilance.
"I don't believe we'd better go on through the wood.
"I will overlook it this time, Miss Savell," Miss Thompson said, "because you are not as yet thoroughly acquainted with the rules of this school, but do not let it occur again.
After an hour's waiting, their patience was rewarded, and the two housebreakers appeared upon the scene.
She had signed her name to the note and requested the others to do the same.
But Miriam will not escape so easily.
"Miriam is a perfect dear now, and is just as enthusiastic over class matters as we are." "It looks as though everything were going to be plain sailing this year," said Jessica.
were moving toward the gymnasium deep in the discussion of the coming game and their chances for success over their opponents.
Anne had composed the song the week before.
"I don't wonder you like to spend your time in it.
Jessica was then detailed to play, and under cover of her music, Tom, Reddy, David and Hippy left the room, Tom returning presently to announce solemnly that an original one-act drama, entitled "The Suffragette," written by Mr.
I move that we proceed at once to elect our president, vice president, secretary and treasurer, and then decide what form of entertainment would be advisable." "Second the motion," said Nora.
The girls had agreed to be there by half past seven.
