My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients from among the officials.
There must have been several in it, and they must have been men of resource and determination.
On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some £ 30, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A.
“Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson.
I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement.
“God help me!” he cried.
A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side.
“It is a curious thing,” remarked Holmes, “that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man’s handwriting.
Then there was a loud and authoritative tap.
As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the _Encyclopædia_ down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me.
Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.
He had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son.
‘And the pay?’ “‘Is £ 4 a week.’ “‘And the work?’ “‘Is purely nominal.’ “‘What do you call purely nominal?’ “‘Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time.
Sherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of _The Times_ and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece.
“The cases which come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough.
“It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won’t speak to me for fifty minutes.” He curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird.
I’ll have the other, and I’ll take it now,’ said I.
“That is the baboon.” I had forgotten the strange pets which the Doctor affected.
“You will excuse me for not waiting for you,” said he; “I have, I foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young Openshaw’s.” “What steps will you take?” I asked.
“Look here, Watson,” he said when the cloth was cleared “just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little.
And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of action.
We are but preventing her from injuring another.
Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest terms.
“This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed, made the inspector realise that the matter was serious.
It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter.
There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself.
A maid rushed across and threw open the window.
It must, then, be something out of the house.
The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance.
The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.
By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle.
His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him.
I could not hear a sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which I was myself.
I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church.
Sherlock Holmes had not come back yet.
My wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning.
Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister.” “One moment,” said Holmes, “are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound?
In dress now, for example.
But my memory and my girl!
My practice is never very absorbing.” “Then put on your hat and come.
‘The only point which I could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fuller’s-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like gravel from a pit.’ “‘Ah!’ said he carelessly, ‘we have our own process.
I thought I heard a ring.” It was, indeed, our friend the financier.
Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death.
THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY We were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid brought in a telegram.
“Frank here and I met in ’84, in McQuire’s camp, near the Rockies, where Pa was working a claim.
They have laid for five.” “Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,” said he.
I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves.
Rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man.
Born in New Jersey in the year 1858.
I may have to go down to Horsham, after all.” “You will not go there first?” “No, I shall commence with the City.
It is all right.” “You have the photograph?” “I know where it is.” “And how did you find out?” “She showed me, as I told you she would.” “I am still in the dark.” “I do not wish to make a mystery,” said he, laughing.
Did he make no attempt to see you?” “Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone.
Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night’s adventure.” “We’re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,” said Jones in his consequential way.
See that light among the trees?
“And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter.
“And I.” “You will excuse this mask,” continued our strange visitor.
You did not see anyone else in the room?” “No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs.” “Quite so.
His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand.
No reference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?’ “‘I have already given you my word.’ “‘Very good.’ He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door.
If we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather?” “As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business.
The lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked.
This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner’s jury.” “It was a confession,” I ejaculated.
Grimesby Roylott’s chamber was larger than that of his step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished.
I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose.” “Certainly, sir,” said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm.
It is past ten, however, and quite time that we started.
“Well, would you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your Highness to the police-station?” “That is better,” said John Clay serenely.
But you will find that all I say is really to the point.
My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room.
“I do not quite follow,” he said.
“My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done very well.
I have the honour to wish you a very good morning.” He bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.
Simon, tapping his fingers upon the table.
It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us.
Then with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar.
Her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage.
Have you a family?’ “I answered that I had not.
Two years ago, having served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father’s death, I determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria Street.
It is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening.
Of course, that is only just for the time.
“One day—it was in March, 1883—a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonel’s plate.
He was an old friend of McCarthy’s, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free.” “Indeed!
It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the affair.
“You’re angry, Robert,” said she.
It may be some time before I get back.
The same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived.
Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back.” “Precisely so.
Of these, one, the _Lone Star_, instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to one of the states of the Union.” “Texas, I think.” “I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an American origin.” “What then?” “I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque _Lone Star_ was there in January, ’85, my suspicion became a certainty.
She wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church.
It was a perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens.
“It makes you quite invaluable as a companion.
He was dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers.
My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed.
A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him.
Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down.
So and so, of Ballarat.” “It is wonderful!” I exclaimed.
Now he looks a little more human.
“Hold up, man, or you’ll be into the fire!
We can’t command our love, but we can our actions.
A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer.
Here we may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved.
“And now, Doctor, perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be.” He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand.
Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.
Pray tell me in what way I can reward you.
Oh, Heaven bless you!” “No more words.
It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses.
_Voilà tout_!” “And Miss Sutherland?” “If I tell her she will not believe me.
The year ’87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest, of which I retain the records.
Some of the general public were present, then?” “Oh, yes.
Simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position.
“No, no; the real name,” said Holmes sweetly.
Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw—yes!
“And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way.
6_d_., glass sherry, 8_d_.’ I see nothing in that.” “Very likely not.
“But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time.
He gives me hopes.” Lestrade shrugged his shoulders.
“None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of Arthur’s.
I had no idea that he was in front of me.
“‘We are now,’ said he, ‘actually within the hydraulic press, and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on.
You should be ashamed of yourself!” “So I am.
Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.’ “Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met.
No doubt you will go to the prison to see James.
I deduced a ventilator.” “But what harm can there be in that?” “Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates.
There is no good for you to do.’ “‘But, madam,’ said I, ‘I have not yet done what I came for.
Holmes walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows.
Must I call you a liar as well as a thief?
All day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of great, hand-made London we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like untamed beasts in a cage.
As I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.
“It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory.
“The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler.
“This is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter.
Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?” The solemn Mr.
Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St.
His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue.
A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window.
“The case is as plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes.
There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office.” “Your experience has been a most entertaining one,” remarked Holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff.
But I take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landlady’s.” Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door.
It is perhaps the best possible solution.
Was dressed in,’ etc., etc.
We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there!
“I am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions,” he said.
“There is a little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes.” “Oh, indeed!” said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air.
Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts.
“It was in the early ’60’s at the diggings.
And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.
I know nothing further of the matter.’ “The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?
“I should wish to.” “Just look it up, then.” “There is a train at half-past nine,” said I, glancing over my Bradshaw.
When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of the house.
I understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of society.” “No, I am descending.” “I beg pardon.” “My last client of the sort was a king.” “Oh, really!
It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better.
Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up.
If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter, Lord St.
It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me.
Those are the principal points about which I wished to be absolutely clear.
I want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may be explained away.
The matter is a perfectly trivial one”—he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat—“but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.” I seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice crystals.
But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts.” As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat.
Holmes, sir,” said the police agent loftily.
I can see him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.
I can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace.
Why, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later.
Old Turner lived for seven months after our interview, but he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past.
It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east.
As he said, what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving me?
I will leave the country, sir.
A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper.
From that appointment he never came back alive.
But when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall.
On the whole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger.
It is possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given.
They were on the upper floor, and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House.
Toller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink.
The pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had seen upon the previous night.
“Pray continue your very interesting statement.” “There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine.
Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.” “It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,” said Holmes.
Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.
She kept talking of what we should do in our future lives.” “Indeed!
Well, he has always answered me like that.
Rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband.
Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions.
Deeply as I have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it.
“They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the house with me.” “Has he come with you to-night?” “No.
Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us could hardly get at one time.
“Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.” III.
At three o’clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned.
Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor.
We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak.” “Certainly.” “And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly wander.” “Quite so.” “Then comes our expedition of to-day.
On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman’s chambers in the Temple.
“That which my son himself indicated—that of the cupboard of the lumber-room.” “Have you it here?” “That is it on the dressing-table.” Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.
I am a dangerous man to fall foul of!
I suppose there would be no chance of a train back.
You are a funny one,” chuckled the inspector.
Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon was shining brightly.
“Remember, Watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years’ penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence.
All was as we had seen it in the daytime.
“May I see it?” “Certainly.” He snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently.
As I ran down the passage, my sister’s door was unlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges.
We stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house.
“Certainly, if you wish it.” “I thank your Majesty.
“Nor from below,” said Mr.
“Well,” said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to London, “it has been a pretty business for me!
“Really, now!” cried the inspector, “you have formed your opinion!
Holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perplexing position.
“In this sinister way I came into my inheritance.
There was no maker’s name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials “H.
It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end.
“I feel it give a little,” said he; “but, though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to break it.
Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within.
If you have not, you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country.
“The third on the right is his,” said the inspector.
“Owe!” He caught up a pen.
James and his father had many disagreements about me.
If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner.
“An accident, I presume?” “By no means.” “What!
Fordham shows you.’ “I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him.
“My God!” I whispered; “did you see it?” Holmes was for the moment as startled as I.
He wore rather baggy grey shepherd’s check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament.
How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office.
“This went on day after day, Mr.
“Do you receive much company?” he asked.
This he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens.
He was a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence.
No servant would stay with us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house.
There were no signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other traces of Mr.
It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned.
She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.
Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which I met it.
“It appeared in all the papers about a year ago.
“It is a nice household,” he murmured.
“If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done it.” “Certainly,” said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the door.
I sent the housemaid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once.
“I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed.
I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection.
His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter.
“We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.” “Your French gold?” “Yes.
Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves.
“It is said that Mr.
Well, then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger.
“Why, it’s a dummy,” said he.
“The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?
Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body.
I passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me.
“That’s it!” cried Hatherley, in intense excitement.
A little over-precipitance may ruin all.” “And now?” I asked.
‘This is all quite beside the question.
I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground.
“‘Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it right to charge.
“The murder was done with it.” “I see no marks.” “There are none.” “How do you know, then?” “The grass was growing under it.
“My messenger reached you, then?” asked Holmes.
“‘I am afraid that that is quite impossible,’ said I.
Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr.
In an instant his strange headgear began to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.
The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs.
See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant.
Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed.
In the present instance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.” The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat.
“‘The ceremony, which was performed at St.
“My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading ‘Tragedy Near Waterloo Bridge.’ Here is the account: “‘Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a splash in the water.
I am prepared to leave it with you as my security.’ “I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client.
And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary.
That brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown.
There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe.
So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St.
It is a little place near the borders of Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading.
Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more successful.” He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman.
Holmes, for I wish you to thoroughly understand the situation.
He made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.
We were engaged after the first walk that we took.
It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself was averse to the idea.
“For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very quiet; on the third, Mrs.
She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants’ escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was all perfectly true.
“‘Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?’ he asked with his eyes open.
I was Isa Whitney’s medical adviser, and as such I had influence over him.
On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table.
Then I walked across to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it.
‘Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey.
Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord St.
It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work.
How cruelly I have misjudged him!” “When I arrived at the house,” continued Holmes, “I at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me.
I should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me.” “Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you.
Simon (the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington.
They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor on the distaff side.
“The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your acquaintance?” “Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season.

The King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged.
“‘May I ask where you live, sir?’ said I.

The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to “Sherlock Holmes, Esq.

She is four-and-twenty.” “This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her also.” “Terrible!
There was a moment’s delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall.
Some, however, have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate.

She is a sunbeam in my house—sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be.
“This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the centre one to your sister’s, and the one next to the main building to Dr.

That he should come to me for help, and that I should send him away to his death—!” He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands.

We neither of us care for it.” “That is unusual in a young girl.” “She is of a quiet nature.
I think it was before your time, Watson.
Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing which I could not give.
This ring—” He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.
“It is a noiseless lock,” said he.
I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences.” Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us.
Sherlock Holmes, “Very truly yours, “IRENE NORTON, _née_ ADLER.” “What a woman—oh, what a woman!” cried the King of Bohemia, when we had all three read this epistle.
For my part, I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it.” He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.
Left his lodgings at ten o’clock at night, and has not been heard of since.
When he reached my sister’s side she was unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness.
Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table, I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing.
Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately.
The daughter told us as much.
Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk the loss of it.
“Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet.
It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has placed in our hands.
“And that is—” “That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.” “Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,” said Holmes, laughing.
I have seen young McCarthy.” “And what did you learn from him?” “Nothing.” “Could he throw no light?” “None at all.
Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I meant it for the best.
Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room.
We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves.” “Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there.
Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was going.
Very retiring and gentlemanly he was.
You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me.” “I am all attention, madam.” “My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.” Holmes nodded his head.
Simon said something about ‘jumping a claim.’ She was accustomed to use slang of the kind.
Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet.
“‘Ten to two.’ “Now a pawnbroker’s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr.
I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly.” “Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?” “Who knows?
“Our quest is practically finished.
I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair.
“That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem.” “It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan,” I remarked.
To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass.
“Hum!” said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, “my theory certainly presents some difficulties.
I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr.
I glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound.
The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes.
By an examination of the ground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as to the personality of the criminal.” “But how did you gain them?” “You know my method.
I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance.
Is the security sufficient?’ “‘Ample.’ “‘You understand, Mr.
And in practice again, I observe.
“No doubt you think me mad?” said he.
Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark upon them.
I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready.
“Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train.
My morning’s work has not been wasted, since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort.
I took two steps forward and looked back.
I shall take nothing for granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it.
‘Not at all,’ said I, ‘I shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes.
We had, however, an aunt, my mother’s maiden sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady’s house.
The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties.” “I thank you,” said the young man, rising and pulling on his overcoat.
Duncan Ross; ‘neither sickness nor business nor anything else.
“They may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently.
“Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your company,” said Sherlock Holmes.
Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future.
“But at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me down to your help.” “That is enough.” She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face.
Then, when they talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him.
there has been an enclosure here!” “Yes, there was a ring.
I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation.
No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.” Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders.
I shall communicate with you.” “Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,” said our client, rising.
I am going out now!” “To the police?” “No; I shall be my own police.
He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money.
As I passed the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, “Walk past me, and then look back at me.” The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear.
I cannot allow that there is any humiliation.” “Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint.” “I fail to see that anyone is to blame.
October 9, 1890.” Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.
Doran’s house that morning.” “Ah, yes.
This business has had a very bad effect upon him.
I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the appointment.” “But with no very good result,” I remarked.
sweating—rank sweating!’ he cried, throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion.
“There is some building going on there,” said Holmes; “that is where we are going.” “There’s the village,” said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left; “but if you want to get to the house, you’ll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the footpath over the fields.
It was twenty-five minutes past four.
Light a cigar and let me expound.” “Pray do so.” “Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young McCarthy’s narrative which struck us both instantly, although they impressed me in his favour and you against him.
Get out of this!” He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.
A fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into.
“Just one hint to you, Lestrade,” drawled Holmes before his rival vanished; “I will tell you the true solution of the matter.
“Won’t it ring?” “No, it is not even attached to a wire.
The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after the other.
“I should not dream of trying,” said he.
Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it might be of some assistance.
I will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world.’ “‘You shall leave it in the hands of the police!’ I cried half-mad with grief and rage.
I should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the Alpha.” “Well then, I shan’t tell you.
“I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night.
Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young McCarthy.
But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure.
It must have bled considerably.” “Yes, it did.
They were a gang, and a rough one, too.
“I fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.” “There are three men waiting for him at the door,” said Holmes.
I know him from the photograph.” The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny.
And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco.
‘I could not bear the disgrace.
“Sold out of geese, I see,” continued Holmes, pointing at the bare slabs of marble.
You seem to have done the thing very completely.
So now!” “Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don’t know why you should be so warm over such a trifle.” “Warm!
Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime.
And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had already made a disturbance at Mr.
He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn’t have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us.
The lady, I think, you have already met.” At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity.
Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?” “No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough.
“You have been cruelly used,” said Holmes.
A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes’ surmise as to his habits.
I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes.
Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety.” Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips.
And, I say, Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring.” When the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it against the light.
Oh, do not waste the so-precious time, but come!’ “This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice.
Then, when he had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested.
“This is the envelope,” he continued.
There is a strong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in Australia.” “What of the rat, then?” Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table.
Each daughter can claim an income of £ 250, in case of marriage.
His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will.
It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller’s-earth was the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose.
However, I threw all fears to the winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off, having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.
Let us follow it out to the bitter end.
“He is looking up at the numbers of the houses.” “I believe that he is coming here,” said Holmes, rubbing his hands.
He has seen too much.
“I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just been serving his time in Pentonville.
Becher a German, very thin, with a long, sharp nose?” The station-master laughed heartily.
I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly injured.
What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?
The other clothes would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr.
He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring disposition.
“Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I could not imagine.
It will end in my being conveyed into the house.
“I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,” said he.
“Here is the slip and here are four letters from him.” “Thank you.
But a human body is a different matter.
It gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it.
I have already arranged what is to occur.
You want to know what became of those geese?” “Yes, sir.” “Or rather, I fancy, of that goose.
He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town.
The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts.
Oakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow.
The front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves.
Your windows would be visible from there?” “Certainly.” “You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, when your stepfather comes back.
I’ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet.” “I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night.
I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.
Come in!” The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes.
They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR The Lord St.
I think that we may judge Lord St.
Pray wait until you have recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me.” The man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against his emotion.
Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures.
But if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place?
That, however, I shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement.” “And you can do nothing until then?” “Nothing.” “In that case I shall continue my professional round.
Besides, what use was my hair to me?
As to my own case, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion.” “Thank you.
“‘Never.’ “‘Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies.’ “‘And what are they worth?’ I asked.
He took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her secret.” “And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,” cried Mr.
This account of you we have from all quarters received.
I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and perhaps write a little note.
“I have spent the whole day,” said he, “over Lloyd’s registers and files of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in ’83.
Holmes, and not to abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back.
And yet, what could have happened?
If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most _outré_ results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable.” “And yet I am not convinced of it,” I answered.
In only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes.
The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor.
Any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them.
From amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.
Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me?
I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed.” “It’s as well,” said the old man; “it’s a question whether I shall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare Alice the shock.
Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque.
In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed.
He put less weight upon it.
“Yes, to-day.” She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in the air.
She came with an excellent character, however, and has always given me satisfaction.
We have known each other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly.
“God knows I have!—a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so sudden and so terrible is it.
Then something suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.” “Is it possible?” gasped the banker.
It is my business to know what other people don’t know.” “But you can know nothing of this?” “Excuse me, I know everything of it.
There is a distinct element of danger.” “Can I be of assistance?” “Your presence might be invaluable.” “Then I shall certainly come.” “It is very kind of you.” “You speak of danger.
For the rest, there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle’s life in America.
A clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.
“Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just didn’t know what I was doing or saying.
“Frankly, now!” she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.
I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the high road, and just a little lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night.
He has been a disappointment to me, Mr.
My wife is very anxious that you should come, for she has been much attracted by my description of you.
He has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation.” “I am delighted to see you,” said she, pressing my hand warmly.
“‘How would fifty guineas for a night’s work suit you?’ he asked.
You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip.
But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady.” “But the money, Mr.
Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this.
“Yes, only one.” “Did you observe the colour?” “Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the carriage.
“I am for west,” remarked the plain-clothes man.
“He has written to me to say that he would be here at six.
Well, that is a list of my town suppliers.
Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause.” “Indeed!
I am a light sleeper, and it has awakened me.
“You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,” said she, as my companion rose to greet her, “but I have had a very strange experience, and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should do.” “Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter.
“It was very sweet of you to come.
I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London.’ “‘That is quite correct,’ I answered; ‘but you will excuse me if I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications.
I trust, sir, that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime.” “I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove it,” returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes.
He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned.
“‘Do you promise, then?’ said he at last.
From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty.
When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was gone.
“There you are,” said he.
His defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman’s clothes.
Besides, it is not I alone.
Merryweather, the stake will be some £ 30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands.” “John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger.
He was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready.
At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man.
Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.” “Ha!
Henry Baker,” said Holmes when he had closed the door behind him.
What d’you want to frighten a chap for?” He sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key.
But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?” “One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow—walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other.
And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected.
Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester.
The only drawback is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.” “Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland?” The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door.
“From Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground.
Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were frequently together.
“What could he have done single-handed against a man in the prime of life?” “He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man.
I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject.
I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every feature.
“A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?
Now where did they come from?” He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood.
He answered that the name was new to him.
Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl.
I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street.
“‘What are you doing there?’ he asked.
It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder.
I had been warned against you months ago.
His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes.
From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us.
“You did it very nicely, Doctor,” he remarked.
He was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone.
Grimesby Roylott’s death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience.” IX.
You have formed some conclusion?
You have him here?” “In the cells.” “Is he quiet?” “Oh, he gives no trouble.
To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.” “I was also aware of that,” murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes.
Then he struck gold, invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.” “Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady’s—your wife’s character?” The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire.
“Pray take a seat,” said Holmes.
Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court.” “Hum!
The name is no doubt familiar to you.” “Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,” murmured Holmes without opening his eyes.
I advertised, and I answered advertisements, but without success.
No one knows a word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible.
Holmes,” said he, “but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now, and not me.
You have dishonoured me forever!
I hurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the Thames.
Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.” “I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,” said Sherlock Holmes.
It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son.
“There are one or two very singular points about this room.
Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?” “Where, indeed?” “It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her.
Heh?’ “‘No,’ said I, considerably astonished at his words.
What will he say when he returns?” “He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track.
The prisoner lay with his face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily.
But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client.
Baker?” “Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.” He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown.
Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me?
Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows.
Now, I’ll state the case clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me.” “Proceed, then.” “Some years ago—to be definite, in May, 1884—there came to Lee a gentleman, Neville St.
‘Why shouldn’t we be married right away, then,’ said he, ‘and then I will feel sure of you; and I won’t claim to be your husband until I come back?’ Well, we talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to Pa.
The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose.” “Which surely he restored to their owner?” “My dear fellow, there lies the problem.
If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second.” Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon.
“In that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept market-place,” said he.
Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind.
“This is the girl’s stepfather, Mr.
A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.
The goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay.
It was the same good friend whose warning I had so foolishly rejected.
I would call your attention very particularly to two points.
You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice.
Above all, try to let Mr.

Then he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled.
“I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain.
I’m sure I beg pardon.
The goose, sir!” he gasped.
He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned upon my companion.
I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from among the others, and in that way has escaped destruction.

Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.
Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.
Frank said that he would go and make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa.
My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature.

Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all.
Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.

He was doing something in the cellar—something which took many hours a day for months on end.
“Pray take a seat.” “I will do nothing of the kind.
Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself.
The self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one.” I shook my head.

“I shall never see them again!” he cried.
This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of training.” “But his wife—you said that she had ceased to love him.” “This hat has not been brushed for weeks.
If his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?” “Precisely.
There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds—a fine big one, white, with a barred tail.

We have a housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way.” “Excellent.
We are at present, Doctor—as no doubt you have divined—in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks.

It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise.

It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the reward offered of £ 1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price.” “A thousand pounds!

Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient.
‘You shall not have a farthing from me,’ I cried, on which he bowed and left the room without another word.
If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us.” “Farewell, then,” said the old man solemnly.

You must lock yourself up from him to-night.
This he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany.

Kindly sign the paper where Mr.
Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?” “Yes, sir.

She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham.
Neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic.

Let’s have it straight, now.” “It is straight enough.
When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.” Mr.
There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in his interest.
I found the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian cigar.
I had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room.” “My dear Holmes!” “I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked before, which were quite as prompt.
Why should she hand it over to anyone else?

I have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time.
All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive.
I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can’t say what turn things are going to take.
The ring, after all, proves nothing.
I then glanced at her face, and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her.” “It surprised me.” “But, surely, it was obvious.

I thought, at any rate, that I should call you and give you the chance.” “My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.” I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him.
How you startled me, Kate!
Do you think that I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?” “I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner.

Singularity is almost invariably a clue.
I assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months.
Her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every little want and forestalling it if possible.
