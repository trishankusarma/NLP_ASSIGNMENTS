The iron prow of the _Merrimac_ crashed through the wooden walls of the _Cumberland_ as if they were cardboard, and, while her crew were still heroically working their guns, the _Cumberland_ went down, with the red flag, meaning "no surrender," flying from her peak.
Every possible effort was made to release the ship, but she was too firmly spiked on the jagged reef to be budged, and the dreaded peril speedily appeared.
It is proper to give at this point the respective strength of the American and Spanish fleets.
Those which impinged against the pilot house or turret did no harm, while the lesser boat was able to dart here and there at will, dodging the _Merrimac_ and ramming her when she chose, though such tactics accomplished nothing.

When the vessels were about a mile apart, the jets of fire and smoke from the side of the _Alabama_, followed by the reverberating boom of her cannon, showed that she had fired her first broadside.

The wound was a frightful one, but, beyond dispute, it saved the life of Decatur, who never forgot the man that had done him this inestimable service.

The Union fleet consisted of 21 wooden vessels and 6 ironclads.
Early in 1864 the lieutenant was made executive officer of the gunboat _Agawam_, and when attached to the North Atlantic squadron, took part in the attack on Fort Fisher, one of the strongest of forts, which, standing at the entrance of Cape Fear river, was so efficient a protection to Wilmington that the city became the chief port in the Confederacy for blockade runners.
The bombardment was continued for three weeks, without inflicting serious damage, and there was little prospect of capturing the place from the river, when General Pope arrived with a large land force; but to reach the fort it was necessary for him to get his troops across the river, and he had not a single transport to use for that purpose.
Decatur was the first to get under way, sailing on May 20 with a squadron consisting of ten vessels, mounting 210 guns.

These cruisers wrought immense havoc among our shipping, and Commander Winslow was sent into European waters in quest of them.
It was of yellow silk, with the device of a rattlesnake, and bore the motto, "Don't tread on me."

Captain Downes then informed them that the expedition would leave the ship at midnight.
