At 11:30 o'clock she reached the turn which seemed to give our vessels so much trouble, and Captain Smith was congratulating himself on the prospect of soon catching up with the flag officer, when his ship grounded and heeled over three streaks to port.
Had Captain Winslow followed, he would have been compelled by law to remain twenty-four hours after the departure of the _Alabama_, so he took a station outside, determined that the cruiser should not escape him again.
Once more among the ice fields, the ships were menaced by danger from every side.
You have already been told considerable about Stephen Decatur, one of the bravest and most chivalrous men that ever drew a sword.
