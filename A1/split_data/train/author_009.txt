In the whole world there could scarcely be found a more lovely view than that which since her birth had presented itself before Kathleen's young eyes.
Plucky people were not as a rule brought into trouble of that sort.
I call David a broth of a boy.
Was she not Kathleen O'Hara, the only daughter of the House of O'Hara, the heiress of her beloved father's old castle?
"I was just able to screw out the money to get one for you and myself.
Nothing would induce me to trouble him on the subject." CHAPTER II.
Now, I can't think what disgrace I have got into, unless some horrid girls have been prying and telling tales out of school.
There never was such a queen," cried Susy Hopkins.
"How can you stand it?" said Kathleen.
And you must stay here too--what is your name?
It is really too trying." "I will go up and see if I can persuade her," said Mrs.
I suppose Dave would beat me black and blue for doing a thing of this sort.
"I will therefore at once proceed to question her," continued Miss Mackenzie.
"Stand just in front of me," she said, "and let me look at you.
Will you--will you?" Of course, Ben fought against Kathleen's rather wicked suggestion; of course in the end he yielded.
Tennant with a great basket of stockings before her.
She has a way of putting information into you so that you cannot help knowing.
She is a brick of bricks.
"Now then," she said, "how is it that all the others have funked it?" "There has been so much muttering and whispering and suspecting going on during the whole livelong day that they were positively afraid," said Susy.
"Now, look here, Kathleen; don't make a fuss.
You must clear out, Thomas; make up your mind to that as soon as ever you have handed over the things to Aunt Church." "You wait and see," said Tom.
Yes, I believe I have done right.
"They will be all agog to come on.
Hopkins's programme was carried out.
See, this is our queen," and she presented Kathleen to the assembled girls.
"Strange, is it not, that I should call myself a Wild Irish Girl when I am a Cockney through and through?
The back-gate that leads into the garden is never locked, and the window I mean to emerge from looks into the garden.
I shall be very glad indeed to be introduced to your grandfather." Ruth made no answer.
Alice is in bed, snoring like anything; I listened outside the keyhole." "Thanks," said Kathleen.
Ah, what a crowd of girls!--colleens we call them in Ireland.
The tramp was hungry and penniless.
She was dressed in rusty black; she had a front of stiff curls on her forehead, a white widow's-cap over it, and a small black crape handkerchief crossed on her breast.
"How are you?" replied Kathleen, just raising her brows, and then turning to say something to Susy Hopkins.
You know Miss Renshaw, don't you?" "Miss Maria Renshaw, the coach.
I know what I'll do: I'll shut up the shop at half-past eight, leave a little note for mother, and then go to the quarry as fast as I can.
"What has come to the little woman?" thought the old man.
She knows no fear, is not guided by any sort of principle, and would, in short, do anything." "Well, go to school, Alice, and be quick home, for I have a great deal I want you to help me with." Alice made no reply, and Mrs.
Anyhow, I have a message for Ruth and I promised to deliver it." "All right, child; don't be longer away than you can help." Susy left the house.
it's lonely I'm likely to be, isn't it, deary?
I will enclose a letter with your brooch.
"You are our queen," said Kate.
If you must go, Mrs.
The sky was cloudless; the few leaves that still remained on the trees looked brilliant in their autumn coloring.
I had a telegram from her desiring me to go to her immediately in town.
She raised herself on her elbow and looked across at Alice.
You shall have a cup of tea and a nice sweet bun with it, and what more can a poor old body like myself offer?
There never was a bath-chair that creaked like that.
I want your promise." "But I have nothing to say." "You are not stupid, Kathleen O'Hara--I can see that--and I should hope you were too much of a lady to be impertinent.
The pale-blue cashmere blouse, with its real lace and embroidered trimmings, might have been worn by any girl, even in the highest station of life.
Still, once she joins she'll have to obey our rules, and I expect our queen will make them somewhat stringent." A clock from a neighboring church struck the half-hour.
And mother says that I may have her to coach me for the big scholarship--the sixty-pounds-a-year scholarship.
I won't tell you the plan, for you mightn't approve; in fact, I can guess in advance that you wouldn't approve.
They look up to you as above them by birth; your very way, your words, can influence them.
And there is that stupid little Ruth--oh, dear!
You will see for yourself how right we are, and how wrong and silly and childish you are.--Miss Ravenscroft, a special meeting of the governors will take place in this room on Saturday morning.
Her lips were firmly shut.
As long as she lived she remembered those two faces, and the words of the lady, and the smile with which she said good-bye.
Don't on any account shut the shop until I appear." Susy, feeling cross and miserable, all her bright hopes dashed to the ground, took a couple of books and went into the shop and sat behind the counter.
They stared open-eyed at Alice when they saw her still sitting in her rough school things, a very cross expression on her face.
The girls reached the school without any further adventure.
Susy preceded her, carrying the little paraffin lamp.
"There are a dozen of us now, and there is talk of a sort of livery or badge for the members of the Cabinet; but we'll know all about it when we meet sharp at nine to-night.
"But this little bit of fun need never be told to any one." Kathleen had let herself out of the house by the strong rope of ivy; she meant to return to her bedroom the same way.
She told me to-day she wouldn't." "She'll be a brick if she doesn't," said Kate Rourke.
"I do hope it's nothing wicked.
If Kathleen would only be quick she might still have time.
Cassandra was looked up to by all her fellow-students, and this not because she was rich, nor because she was beautiful, but simply because she was good and honorable and trustworthy; she possessed a large amount of sympathy for nearly every one, her tact was unfailing, and she was never self-assertive.
"You know, Alice," she said, "the child is very lovable and kind-hearted--a little barbarian in some senses of the word, but a fine nature--of that I am certain." "I am so busy to-night, mother," replied Alice.
Tennant looked at Kathleen with loving eyes.
Why are you going out?" "I want to see a school friend." "You will be back in time for tea, won't you?" "Can't say." "But your mother, the poor tired one, asked you to be back." "I do wish, Kathleen, that you wouldn't call mother by that ridiculous name.
Then there were frills and ribbons and veils; there were two great, big, very stylish-looking hats, with long plumes; and there was a little toque made of crimson velvet, which Kathleen declared was quite too sweet for anything.
"Aunt Church wants to get into one of those almshouses." "Just like her--stingy old thing!" said Mrs.
But that is a long time ago.
Her grimace was so comical that all the small girls in the class burst out laughing.
I must stop, for it's more than the heart of woman can stand.
"And I do hope, also, that you won't make yourself a merry-andrew or a figure of fun at the Weldons' to-night.
"I had a note asking me to call at six o'clock.
"If the rest are so timid, there's more fun for us; isn't that so?" She looked round at her companions.
"She is magnificent." And then both girls felt the little heart-shaped lockets round their necks and thought of themselves as heroines.
They wandered to Kathleen and the Wild Irish Girls' Society; they wandered to her other schoolfellows; they wandered to the hardship of having to take care of the shop when she wished to be otherwise employed; and finally they settled themselves on Ruth Craven.
"Now, Cassie," she said, "what is it?" "Oh, can't you guess for yourself, Flo?
I will go to see Aunt Katie O'Flynn; nothing shall keep me back." Carried away by the wild wave of passion which consumed her, Kathleen dressed hastily for her expedition.
She must return with me at once." "But I can't.
Will you promise me something, Cassie?" "You look so imploring that I'd like to promise you anything; but what is it?" "Do take her part when the time comes.
This gaily dressed little person entered a room full of sober people.
"Next door to pride comes honesty.
I think some of the girls know exactly how to manage." "Well, I tell you what.
"Susan Hopkins, I don't like you nor your ways.
"It's my opinion," she said, speaking in a slow, emphatic, rather awful voice, "that you are a very, very bad little girl.
"Now look here; if you bring that charming young lady to see me, and give me notice a day or so before--Tom can run over and tell me--if you and Tom and Miss Kathleen O'Hara would come and have tea at my place, why, it's the freshest of the plumcakes we'd have, not the stalest.
Time had been given Kathleen to take her place, to recover any emotion she might have felt by her sudden entrance, and then Miss Ravenscroft rose to her feet.
Do you know, I offered to walk home with her yesterday, and she said, 'No, I thank you; I prefer to walk home alone,'" As Hannah made this speech she adopted the mincing tones which she supposed Ruth Craven had used.
The best china was accompanied by some quite good knives and forks.
So was the head-mistress, Miss Ravenscroft; and also, seated on the same little raised platform, were the six ladies who formed the governors.
Kathleen drew herself up proudly.
Finally, she took the box of pale-blue cashmere blouses and opened it in the light of the lamps.
I should love to be Prime Minister to Kathleen O'Hara.
I should take it very kindly if you would.
I mean to take every scrap of good the place opens out to me.
The little lady was not young, but was certainly very fascinating.
We have such a place at home, too.
Now, Ruth belonged to this rare class, and Susy, without quite understanding it, felt it.
I don't understand you." "You will presently," said Susy.
I am sure no one could look sweeter than I do in my pale-blue blouse.
"No, dear; she has gone to church.
You are good; you are very, very good." Ruth caught one of Cassandra's hands and raised it to her lips.
She sleepily proceeded with her dressing.
She told the girls at dinner that she would be home for tea, that she expected to be rather tired, and hoped that they would be as good as possible.
She and Kathleen laughed over the shrimps, exclaimed at the fun of eating the water-cress, enjoyed the sausages, and each drank four cups of tea.
My dear child, the whole thing is a mistake.
"I think--" said Ruth suddenly.
Do let me examine the till." "Are you quite positive that no one came into the shop?" "Nobody, mother." "You did not leave the shop even for a moment?" "Yes; I went to sit in the parlor." "Oh, Susy?
Well, no more for the present.
"I'll ask father if I may have you at Carrigrohane in the summer, and then see if you don't believe.
It isn't so much Miss O'Hara we mean.
They are taught liberally; they have the best rooms, the best laboratories; the best music, the best art, are supplied to them.
It was a beautiful day in the beginning of winter, with that feeling of summer in the air which comes to cheer us now and then in November.
"Why are they not in their different classrooms?" "Go in--go in," said the monitress.
You must call that rich." "I'm afraid I don't," said Kathleen.
It will be hard on you, but you won't ruin so many of us.
She for a short time belonged to the rebels, as I must call the Wild Irish Girls, but she saw the folly of her conduct and left them.
"It means such drudgery, and I don't believe I'd play a bit better if I did." "That is certainly not the case, Kathleen," said Miss Spicer.
What would my darling father say if I told him that I was going to curry favor with the girls of the Great Shirley School?
Ruth's remark was unexpected, but the girls pooh-poohed Hannah's.
Is not my father a sort of king in old Ireland?
One of the tiny tots looked towards her.
It is principally because my affinity won't have anything to do with me; she is attaching herself to another, and that other is little better than a monster.
She felt feverish and excited.
She bobbed here; she bobbed there.
She looked to right and left.
I must go out on important business.
But several of the foundationers themselves knew this; nevertheless the fun of the whole thing, the particular fascination which Kathleen herself exercised over her followers, kept them her undeniable slaves, and not for the world would any of them have left her now that they had sworn fealty to her cause.
Ruth Craven has come to spend the day with me.
Whatever they meant by that, most people did what David Tennant liked.
She felt a wave of tempestuous blood pressing against her heart; then it all rushed back in a fiery color into her cheeks and in brightness to her eyes.
So you'll have to reckon with me on the occasion of the next meeting." Kathleen sat very still, her face thoughtful.
During her husband's lifetime the stationer's shop had gone well and provided a comfortable living for his wife, son, and daughter.
Tennant, but Kathleen ran up to her and kissed her.
The school came to an end quite in the usual manner.
She is ever so kind, and so interested.
"Come, my pet, and let's have a little talk." "Go, Susy, and be quick about it," said her mother.
It's gloating and fussing over my clothes I will be--portioning out those I mean to give to others, and trying on the ones that will suit me.
The old lady took them from her and disappeared into the kitchen.
I don't think its fair, whatever you may say to the contrary." Mrs.
Hopkins, "I have notions in my head.
She had entered the Shirley School when quite a little child, had gone steadily up through the different classes and the various removes, until she found herself nearly at the head of the sixth form.
When Susy saw Kate Rourke and Ruth Craven she uttered a little scream of delight.
we shall have a fine right side of the ledger when little Ruth has brought home sixty pounds a year." Ruth stifled a groan.
You needn't wait up; I promise to lock up carefully." "Very well, dear," said Mrs.
She isn't a bit better than the rest of us." "And I love her already." "She is no better than the rest of us," repeated Susan Hopkins.
"Grandfather," she said, "are you all right now--quite wide awake, I mean?
She lives with mother--I mean she boards with mother." "Why isn't she here?" "She got your letter.
"I allude," she said, "to the insurrection in our midst--a sort of civil war in our camp.
And I ran away to see you.
By all the laws of the foundationers, Ruth ought to speak to her companions in misfortune.
"'It's putting a bit of color into your cheeks.
Some ladies were buying stamps as Susy dashed through the shop on her way to the family rooms at the back.
"You are prepared to reply to the following questions?" she said.
You make me very uncomfortable by going on in this extremely silly way, Kathleen." "I will darn some more socks for you, darling, tired pet," whispered Kathleen coaxingly.
"What are you saying, 'Well, I never!' for?" asked Kathleen.
She went down a small lane, turned to her right, and found herself in a mean little street full of small shops.
It can't be at all ill-convenient to you to give it to me when you can afford blouses of that quality for your impudent young daughter.
Good-bye, grandfather." She kissed him; then she raised her flower-like head and walked out of the room with a gentle dignity all her own.
"But the question is now," said the girl, "what are we to do to make her have some of these pretty things?
Ruth came in looking very white, her face dogged, her usual beauty and charm of manner having quite deserted her.
The Great Shirley School, well as it was managed, had perhaps a larger share than many schools of those temptations which make school a world--a world for the training either for good or evil of those who go to it.
She is going to be a great power in the land, is that child, with her beauty and her talent; there's nothing she can't aspire to." "Now don't you be a silly old man," said Mrs.
She poured some out now, very unwillingly, for Kathleen, who drew the cup towards her, stirred it absently, and began to read her letters.
There's your own old bath-chair that Uncle Church used to be moved about in before he died." "To be sure, there is," said Mrs.
Her influence was altogether felt amongst the foundationers.
There were eager voices and sounds of people hurrying about, and then a fragrant smell of fried sausages.
And how well it fits!
You can go on, of course, Alice; I will follow presently." "We are rather late as it is," said Alice.
Nevertheless, Ruth Craven must fall if necessary for the good of the many.--Ruth, I wish to ask you a certain question.
You must run round this afternoon and make arrangements.
How is everybody at home?
"But you mustn't go, miss; it would be madness--wicked.
"You will have to bear it now, my pet, unless you have real cause for complaint.
I may not be in until late.
I must be at the quarry whatever happens to-night.
"I have dared to do what none of them approved of, and I am not a bit the worse for it.
The girl had a very vivid color in her cheeks, intensely bright and roguish dark-blue eyes, light chestnut hair touched with gold--hair which was a mass of waves and tendrils and fluffiness, and on which a little dark-blue velvet cap was placed.
Not for a moment had Kathleen thought of this way of looking at her escapade until she read the truth in the eyes of the unknown but most kind lady.
Then I'd be perfectly happy.
"I am fifteen, bless your heart, darling!" replied Kathleen.
"It was disgusting of the others to funk it.
She was thinking of her grandfather, and of what it would mean to him and the old grandmother when she came back on Saturday a disgraced girl, expelled from her high estate, her golden chance snatched from her.
Don't you remember when I told you to have all those little hearts made for me?" "To be sure, dear--the most extraordinary idea I ever heard in my life.
"From your description it seems to be a sort of death in life, that town of Merrifield." "I have to make my own diversions, aunty, and they are sprightly and entertaining enough.
If any special customers come in I will attend to them." "No, Tommy can't.
On the way she met Mrs.
"Come, little Irish colleen," he said.
Prayers were held as usual in the great hall, and then the members of the different classes went to their places and the work of the morning began.
She is a most sweet girl; she is a lady placed in a position which a lady should scarcely occupy, but through it all she will never betray the true instincts of her nature." "I am sure of that.
Kathleen's musical genius was already spoken of with much approbation by the rest of the school.
For instance, now--But I mustn't tell you; it would not be right.
Ruth removed her hat, brushed out her black hair, saw that her dress, shabby as it was, was in apple-pie order, put on a neat white apron, and ran downstairs.
They're rattling at the door like anything, and there's a detestable boy now whistling 'Garry Owen' right into my heart.
Church; "and I must say," she added, "that I am pleased.
Let the head-mistress and the governors say what they please." "Hurrah for Kathleen O'Hara!
"Now then, Maria," she said, "shall I run down to the kitchen and bring up the hot bacon and the porridge?
Hopkins fairly lost her temper.
They were about half-way through breakfast when there came a ring at the front-door, and Cassandra Weldon's voice was heard.
All we want is our fun, a little bit of liberty, and to show those companions who look down upon us that we are as good as they, and that we will fight for each other, and have our own way, and meet when we please, and do as we like out of school hours.
Susy ushered her visitors with great pride and pomp into Mrs.
"I don't know," replied Kathleen.
Hopkins in an annoyed voice.
You can read it, only don't tear it all to bits." The girls did read the letter.
She has told me you have been good to her." "She has been very good to me.
oh, dear!" Kathleen flew downstairs.
Girls--Wild Irish Girls, you who belong to my society--I as your queen desire you to come forward.
"You are very naughty, Kathleen," said Mrs.
Well, I am certain that Ruth won't betray her companions." "I forgot," said Florence, "that she did belong to that silly society.
"Which is the Hôtel Métropole?" "Oh, miss, it is quite close.
We always keep the shop, except the post-office part, open until past nine on Wednesdays; such a lot of people come in for odds and ends on this special night.
I mean to write to Aunt Katie O'Flynn to-morrow and give her a fine piece of my mind.
They are none of them much to boast of." "What fun this is!" cried Susy again.
"I have been called back," she said in a whisper to her little peppermint companion.
Isn't it worth anything to see that blessed trunk?
I am wicked to-day--quite wicked; I could hate any one who opposes me.
Well, but we'll talk of the bag when you have said whatever else you have got at the back of that wise little head of yours." "I have got news that may mean a great deal to you, but before I tell it I want you to give me a promise.
"We must make a few rules," she continued when her young companions had ceased to shout--"just a few big rules which will be quite easy for all of us to obey." "Certainly," said Kate.
They say if it got to the governors' ears every foundationer in the place would be expelled.
"There's that kettle singing like mad, and it will boil over in a minute.
You have a sweet little voice of your own, although it hasn't the dear touch of the brogue that I miss so in all the other girls." "But you like Miss Tennant don't you?" said Ruth.
There won't be many customers at this hour." "Oh, mother, I did really want to work hard at my lessons.
Hopkins could ill afford to lose so large a sum as nineteen-and-sixpence out of her small earnings.
"You may sleep till doomsday as far as I am concerned." "Polite," muttered Alice.
She had neatly packed the little Irish diamond brooch in a box, and had slipped under it a tiny note: "Get as many foundation girls as you can to meet me, at whatever place you like to appoint, this evening.
Susy would have to do a lot of exercises; these she could not by any possibility do in the shop.
they are getting into hot water," she said to herself.
We'd better wire to your father to keep the little cottage vacant until we know more.
I want the money; I want it just as much as your poor mother does." "But you have money in the bank, haven't you?" "That is no affair of yours, Tom Hopkins.
Church as well as she could out of the bath-chair.
"That's about it," said Kathleen.
He had a real turn for the microscope." "Then, of course, you will leave it behind you; of course you will give it to me," said Tom, quite triumphant with eagerness.
"She's quite the very prettiest girl I ever saw," cried Alice Tennant; "but of course we can have nothing to do with her.
She could not help wondering what Ruth would do--whether she would continue to be a valuable aid to the queen of the new society, or whether she would give them up altogether.
There's nothing like seeing things for yourself.
"I must go back now, for I have promised to go for a walk with Mrs.
Kathleen was very glad that morning to get the boys' attention.
You will come to no good.
Her talents were of the most brilliant order; her very faults seemed in one way to add to her charms.
Then I observed dear, pretty little Ruth Craven, and some one said to me, 'You won't take much notice of Ruth, for she's only a foundation girl.' That made me mad.
She is very pretty, isn't she?
"I haven't a scrap of heart in my body to-day," he remarked to his chosen friends.
"Come along, Ruthie; we will be late.
You have only to go out of the station, take the second turning to your left, walk down Northumberland Avenue, and you'll be there." "But where is Northumberland Avenue?
She darted to one side of the road.
"Why, Kathleen is like a fairy godmother.
"Come here, child," she said.
"We must make her our queen.
"I shall feign sleepiness at a quarter to nine," she said to herself, "and go upstairs.
"Let me in, please, Kathleen; let me in," called Alice's voice.
"She felt she could not be with me and with those who do not approve of the paying girls." "There you are!" said Miss Ravenscroft.
It was a curious party for such a room and for such surroundings.
The Home-Sick and the Rebellious 34 V.
Hopkins's manner and words put the little girl into a passion, and she was determined now not to say a word.
You didn't tell me that you were going out.
Don't you have anything to do with them, boys." But the boys only begged more earnestly than ever to have a look at Kathleen.
Occasionally, too, if the conversation is sorrowful, tears flow and sobs come from the excited and over-sensitive hearts.
Sit down now and sup your porridge.
"It seems unfair to give the cottages entirely to Irish people.
I will go to them at once.
She had a jealous contempt of Ruth Craven, who, although a foundation girl, managed to look like a lady; but her envy was centered round Cassandra.
Those girls who possessed any talent or any specially strong characteristic had every chance offered to them in the Great Shirley School; their futures were more or less assured, for the governors of the school had powers to give grants to the clever girls, to award scholarships for which all might compete, and to encourage industry, honesty, and charitable ideas as far as possible.
How nice of Alice to be sound asleep!
Every one combines to spoil her; I don't see that she has the least chance." Cassandra talked a little longer to Alice, and then prepared to go home.
Miss Mackenzie looked hard and very firm.
"Nothing will induce me to give them up," she said, or to betray any girl of my society.
"I won't tell you how I got it, nor who gave it to me.
Susy's own home was a palace in comparison.
You will remember my words when the prophecy comes true.
"If I can help you, you dear, tired, worn one, I shall be only too glad." "I am sure, mother," said Alice, "it is very good of Kathleen to wish to do the household work; but as she has been sent here to gain some information of another sort, do you think it ought to be allowed?" "And who will prevent it, darling?
"If you take her part I shall hate you all the rest of my life," said Alice, speaking with great passion.
We won't be in time for school in the morning if we stay talking any longer." CHAPTER XI.
She was stout, and she wore a short jacket and a big--very big--picture-hat." "You don't mean," said Mrs.
"I cannot answer because I know nothing," she said.
The color rushed into Ruth's cheeks.
You must oblige me this time, Susy.
I'll just run round to the shop and buy them.
"We will defer the subject of Kathleen O'Hara until I have the pleasure of speaking to her," she said then.
Perhaps, after all, I am mistaken, about Ruth; perhaps she is not my real proper affinity.
Tennant, I am afraid you must, for the next train leaves Charing Cross for Merrifield at ten minutes past nine." Mrs.
Florence was a very nice girl, but jealousy was her bane.
Now then, Ruth Craven, will you come a little more forward?
It is horrid of them to grudge us our little bit of amusement." Susy agreed with her friend; indeed, during those days she was nearly lifted off her feet, so excited was she, so charmed, so altogether amazed at Kathleen O'Hara's condescension to her.
We did an awful thing coming to town; I know we did, and I feel--oh, detestable!" Kathleen bent her head forward, covered it with her hands, and sat still.
There'll be about thirty or forty of us, and we must all be smuggled into the cottage." "Oh, dear!" said Susy.
"These are to make a pudding," she said.
When I leave school I'll be able to take the position my dear father, had he lived, would have wished for me.
Tennant's face to Alice's, and from Alice's to those of the boys.
Craven was not in the kitchen.
I am so glad I have taken steps to prevent that horrid friendship with Cassandra coming to anything!
"Ruth Craven." "Your age?" "I am fourteen." "Where do you live?" "In No.
You certainly ought to do what she suggests." "But I am afraid," said Kathleen, "that I am not going to do what I ought.
Craven happened to be out, but old Mr.
The face was most lovely, and the back of the shabby frock was covered by hair as black as jet, and curling and rippling in the sunshine.
And I rather fancy Kathleen is the sort of girl whom no one will betray.
You know most of the names of the members.
It's hard enough to make ends meet without adding any more difficulties." Mrs.
Early in the day, dad, I did not think that I could stay at all; but I have got a plan in my head now, and if I succeed I may at least put up with one term of this detestable school.
It was quite an extraordinary thing for the paying girls of the Great Shirley School to be so interested and excited about a foundationer.
Susy had never appealed to the old lady's fancy, and she appealed less than ever to-day.
Ruth went up to her gravely.
"I'm not going to be nasty to you any more," she said.
Is anything the matter?" "Kiss me," said Ruth.
I was obliged to shut the shop.
She'd never cry or despair; that wasn't her way, bless you!
Are their scandalous proceedings a nightly occurrence?" "Oh, no; I do not think they meet oftener than once a week." "Have you any idea what night they choose?" "I am rather under the impression that this is the night." "Then send some one to see, Miss Ravenscroft.
Whoever is there has nothing to do with us." Susy's state of panic amused both Miss O'Flynn and Kathleen, and Tom was the only one found brave enough to go to the door in answer to the knock.
I am late as it is.
Oh, we will take it out of them, sha'n't we?" Kathleen made no reply.
The thing must be put a stop to, and with a high hand; and to show you, my dear, what we mean to do, we have presented an ultimatum to Ruth Craven.
I must go and help granny now." "That's right; that's a good girl.
She saw Alice, and took to her heels.
"There are no two opinions on the matter," continued Miss Ravenscroft.
It was a quarter past eight.
She slipped some sovereigns into her purse, tucked it for safety into the bosom of her dress, and then put on her hat and jacket.
Do you know, I never thought of that.
She soon jumped up and walked across the little passage into the drawing-room.
Alice, I should like to know which is best--to be horribly cross, or to tell nice polite lies.
Her mother asked her what ailed her.
What do you think happened?
The girls were to meet at the station at half-past five.
I prophesy a bad end for you, and trouble for your unfortunate mother.
We cannot have our next meeting until I have drawn up the rules, and I should like Ruth Craven to help me.
But it is sad to relate that when a girl is bent on mischief she is even more mischievous, more daring, more defiant when the sun shines and the earth looks gay.
The blouse was very dainty and pretty, and unlike anything she could afford to buy for her only daughter.
"Now," said old granny when the meal had come to an end, "you stay and talk to your grandfather--he is all agog to hear what you have got to say--and I will wash up.
She was very bright and very smart, and even Alice gave her an approving glance.
I must get to my accounts, little miss, but I am right glad to see you." Kathleen felt a lump in her throat.
Kathleen--I will always love you and be faithful to you--but I can't give up the scholarship." "I don't want you to," said Kathleen; "but why shouldn't you belong to me and yet take the scholarship?
I believe there are a great many girls willing to join.
"Step up here, Miss Craven," said Miss Mackenzie.
Her feet grew icy cold; she could scarcely follow the meaning of her somewhat difficult lessons.
I will watch her and find out if I agree with you.
By-and-by the sermon came to an end, the voluntary rolled forth from the organ, and the crowd of worshippers poured out.
"They're so gay and full of life, and are so ridiculously witty.
We are never rude like that in Ireland.
She had crossed the common when she looked behind her; Alice was still running, but she was also in the distance.
I am a rebel by nature.
I must get back to the school again by half-past two.
To tell the truth, Alice was not at all taken in by Kathleen's headache.
Naylor had traces of tears in her eyes, and bent forward several times to whisper something to Miss Mackenzie, who invariably shook her head and looked more stern than ever.
Kathleen smiled back at her.
"Why, Tom," said his mother, looking at him with admiration, "you are a smart boy.
"I will join the others, although I don't approve," said Hannah Johnson, with a somewhat unwilling nod.
While the ladies were enjoying their meal they did not observe that a round boyish face occasionally appeared at the little glass partition which divided Mrs.
She was a little, wizened lady with a face like a russet apple, a kindly smile, and a sweet voice.
"What is wrong?" "There is plenty wrong," said Susy.
Church had a certain power about her, and she impelled Susy to come forward.
Maybe I will want more before the term is up, or maybe I won't.
If I were to tell I should be a traitor to Kathleen.
She must have thought of you, Ruth, when she ordered these sweet pale-blue colors, for that color is yours, isn't it?" "I suppose so," said Ruth.
"Go away," she called out.
She is too pale for blue," was Mrs.
Alice caught a glimpse of her bright face by the light of the moon, which was already getting up in the sky.
Stand here and pour your words into my ear.
"Bring Miss O'Hara in at once.
They ceased to be attentive to their lessons; they were often discovered in school in a state of semi-drowsiness; they were rebellious and impertinent to their teachers--in short, they were in a state of insurrection.
"It isn't the first time that Kathleen and I have got up with the sunrise.
She said she was expecting two young ladies." "Well, I am one of them.
Cassandra had, however, two more terms of school-life before her, and these terms she regarded as the most valuable of her whole education.
You know what your father was.
"The old quarry," whispered Rosy.
"But now to return to the more immediate business.
Yes, I suppose I am uncivilised, and I never want to be anything else.
I told granny I did not exactly know what time I should be back, but she certainly wouldn't expect me to be out late." "Never mind; you are doing me a kindness.
She can't have the girls--the Wild Irish Girls, I mean--any longer at the quarry, for it's getting noised abroad in the school, and there are those who'd think very little of telling on us; and then we might all be expelled, for it's contrary to the rules of the governors that there should be anything underhand or anything of that sort in the place.
But now, are you going to help Miss Kathleen, or are you not?
What she said to him even Susy did not hear, but when the little girl returned to Mrs.
Now we must sit down to dinner at once." During dinner Kathleen's eyes sparkled so brightly, and she looked so merry and mysterious, that both the boys gazed at her in wonder.
No one ever had a clearer head for business or for right and wrong than grandfather when he is at his best.
And you know that if you press me now to return the money in full I'll have to sell up the shop, and the children won't have anything to eat, and we'll all be ruined.
I only get the chance three times a week, and I must not neglect it." "David hopes to be no end of a swell some day," remarked Ben.
I can't give myself or the other girls in the school away.
Hopkins--Susy Hopkins's mother?" "Indeed, my dear, I'm truly thankful to say I am not.
The table, the chairs, and the little sideboard were pushed about; everything seemed to be at a loss until Susy peremptorily took the duster out of Tom's hand and reduced chaos to order.
In an instant she had climbed up and was seated securely in one of its lower branches.
"I will open the door of the parlor and sit there.
That's the right figure, isn't it, for the best things at a jumble sale?
"Knowledge must be of assistance.
Where did you buy it?" Now Susy had really no intention of making a secret with regard to the blouse.
Miss Ravenscroft thought of mother; she knew that mother would like to have a boarder who would pay her well.
"You needn't reply unless you like, pet," she said.
I quite hate her, with all her pretty face and her mincing ways." "Never mind, Kitty," said Hannah Johnson.
"I can easily do it; it is but to swing on to that thick cord of ivy and I shall reach the ground without the slightest trouble.
"I can send a commissionaire down to tell your grandfather that I am keeping you for the night." "Of course, Ruth," said Kathleen.
Alice was accompanied by a tall, showily dressed girl.
Telegrams were by no means common things at the Tennants' house.
"That is the curious part of it.
Ruth's hat, too, left much to be desired.
Susy, I told you the kettle would boil before we were ready for tea.
"But what do you propose to do, then?" said Miss Mackenzie.
Of course, I know that you are very pretty and fascinating, and that lots and lots of girls love you, and will always love you.
"If that is the money you have in your hand," she said, noticing that the child held a small parcel, "you may give it to me, and then go over there and get me that black cash-box.
"I should think they would like it.
The fact was that she was very modest and a perfect lady, and it was impossible to feel anything but good-will towards her.
"I tell you what, Ruth," he said; "I must think over it.
Now Cassandra, who had many friends in the school, had amongst them, of course, her greatest friend.
She's in such a taking about little Peter; she's quite certain he's in for measles or something worse.
It is far better for the school not to have anybody like her in its midst.
I have respected him more than any man I ever knew.
"Now is my time," thought Kathleen.
I will talk the matter over with you to-morrow." "And you will find me unchanged," said Kathleen.
Oh, how many she was defying: Ruth Craven, who would almost have given her life to keep her back from this; Miss Ravenscroft, the head-mistress, to whom Kathleen's heart did not go out; her own father; her own aunt; Alice Tennant--oh, bother Alice Tennant!
It means money, mother; of that I am certain.
I must be off." "Why are you going so early?
she is your mistress--the head-mistress of the Great Shirley School." "Well, and what about that?
Susy had secured a candle in a tin candlestick, with which she had lighted herself to her bedroom, but when she got there she had no intention of putting up with such feeble illumination.
She has got an uncle and aunt in Chicago, and they are as rich as can be; and her uncle is coming to see her at Christmas.
And can you let me have it as quick as quick can be?
I am not a bit rude.
The girls had all been watching her.
THE BOX FROM DUBLIN AND ITS TREASURES.
She strutted about among the neighbors, and they said, 'Fine feathers make fine birds,' and laughed at her past bearing.
I can do all those things, and I can mix whisky punch, and I can sing songs to the dear old dad, and I can comfort my mother when her rheumatics are bad.
It was quite true that Mrs.
"I sha'n't be up for quite an hour, and you will be sound asleep by that time." "I won't lock it," replied Kathleen gently.
"What can she have found out?" she thought.
"I am glad," she said to herself, "the right side of the ledger means giving up all, and the best of life is to be able to lose it if necessary.
I don't think I ought to join at all," said Ruth.
As she could not mend matters, she did not see why she should worry about them.
"I love both their memories.
"Ruth," she said, "you must come home with, me to dinner.
Her dress consisted of a black velvet skirt over a crimson petticoat, and her bodice was of crimson silk very much embroidered and with elbow-sleeves.
You couldn't go so late by yourself; it wouldn't be right." Miss O'Flynn, however, had not come in contact with a character like Ruth's before.
The owner of the house did not care to spend more than a very limited sum of money on coals and food.
The Box from Dublin and Its Treasures 93 IX.
"But there!" said the old man hastily.
They know, however, that its influence is bad in the school, and they are determined to crush it out.
She looked to the right then, and met as many more faces of girls whom she knew, and who were members of the Wild Irish Girls' Society.
"I am a Wild Irish Girl." "That you ain't.
But what shall it be?" She thought excitedly.
I suppose she didn't understand; she is so new to schools.
Hopkins's lamentations, and desired her to send Tom to her to inspect him, and had finally handed over the money, which was to be paid back by monthly installments within the space of three years.
"I think we shall do now very well." Susy and Tom quite agreed with their mother.
"I hope not," said Miss Mackenzie; "but I as chairwoman am obliged to question her.--Ruth Craven, is it true that you became a member of a silly schoolgirl society called the Wild Irish Girls, and that you wore a badge like this?" Ruth nodded.
Cassandra Weldon offers me an advantage which I dare not throw away.
This romantic abode was situated in the extreme south-west of Ireland.
Kathleen did the necessary introducing, and the two ladies moved a little apart to talk together.
"I sent for you last night and you did not obey my command.
Don't be harsh," gasped little Mrs.
And then, you know, when you appeared she began to butter me up like anything.
Hopkins, whose cheeks were flushed, and who looked considerably worried, replied that it had been left to her by her own mother.
And for my part I should love to stay." "I am sorry, Kathleen," said Ruth, "but I must go home.
Her expression was bewitching, and when she smiled a dimple came in her cheek.
Oh, aunty, there's such a funny old woman!
The two girls kept whispering together in the passage.
Miss Ravenscroft did not invite her to reseat herself.
Do you know, Kathleen, I think he'd like to see you.
Now just see that you do what I want; and the sooner the better, you understand.
"He was the cleverest man I ever came across.
This is worth a great deal." Meanwhile Kathleen rang the bell at Sans Souci in a very smart, imperative manner.
"It is the one thing that keeps me alive," she said.
"Is that all?" said Kathleen.
Church, I will write to father and let you know if there is a vacancy; and you could come back with me in the summer, couldn't you?" "Oh, miss, it would be heaven!" "Can't we go out and have a walk now, Susy?" said Kathleen, who found the small parlor a little too close for her taste.
She knelt for a moment at her bedside and prayed that God would keep her from quite hating Kathleen.
I wonder what will happen, Kathleen.
And then Kathleen was so fascinating; her eyes were so bright; she was such a valiant sort of leader.
Her hair was neatly arranged; her face was calm.
Alice had long ceased to torment Kathleen about her own side of the room.
"Why, my dear Alice," said her mother, looking up at this moment, "what did Cassandra want?
You will come to-night, in any case, won't you?" "Yes, I will come to-night; but I am not happy about it, and I wish Kathleen--Oh, I know it is very fascinating, and Kathleen is just delightful, but I should not like our teachers to know." "Of course not," said Susy, staring at her.
I don't want to have anything to do with Tom's friends.
She ceased to fiddle with her apron, and clasped her two little white hands tightly together.
"Won't Tom respect me when he sees me in it on Sunday?
But, all the same, I'm surprised to see you here to-night." "But why so?" asked Ruth.
You will enjoy that--won't you, Thomas?" "See if I don't, Aunt Church.
But what do you want to see your aunt for?" "It is a little private message in connection with Miss Kathleen O'Hara.
Ruth longed to avoid them, but they saw her and clustered round her, and each and all began to whisper in her ears: "You will be faithful, Ruth; nothing will induce you to tell.
"It is I that must leave you, my darling," she said.
The message is to the effect that if those silly girls who have allied themselves to that most ridiculous society, the Wild Irish Girls, will give the name of their leader, they shall be forgiven.
Are you Irish?" said the girl.
Have you a young man, Maria?
"It is quite evident that a society calling itself by this name exists, and that it has been instituted and formed altogether by Kathleen O'Hara, who has induced a great number--I should say fully half--of the foundationers to join her.
When she got as far as the school door she turned to Mrs.
She is quite hopeless," said Alice.
Just for a moment Kathleen had felt frightened at Alice's words, but then she cast them from her mind.
Gold and sunshine and rich color and marvellous dreams had all come into her life since the arrival of Kathleen at Merrifield.
Laughter sometimes checks the eager flow of words.
I won't keep you now, Miss Purcell." Alice ran the rest of the way.
Wherever did you get it from?
"What with the finery for my dear, darling chosen ones, and the badges for all the members, I shall do." She was utterly reckless with regard to expense.
"I really and truly, Kathleen, do want to help you.
She now turned to Susy.
But if I do this I certainly can't take advantage of Cassandra's kindness.
Miss Ravenscroft would do anything to catch us; but Aunt Church says that if you go into the yard she doesn't think you will be seen or heard.--May I take the girls into the yard, Kathleen?
But had I the choice I would have stayed with Kathleen." "Well, it is all a mystery to me," said Cassandra.
She clenched her hands so tightly that the nails went into the delicate flesh.
I am in luck; I am--I am." Her mother's hand knocking on the wall brought her down from the clouds.
"What you call a nice lie is just a very great and awful sin; and if you don't believe me, go to church and listen when the commandments are read." "In future," said Kathleen very calmly, "now that I really know your views, I will always tell you _home truths_.
They left the theater very slowly, with all the lightsomeness and gladness of heart gone.
He was a very handsome boy.
She then got back into bed.
It was quite, quite impossible to suppose that anything so monstrously unfair as that a little girl should be expelled from the school could happen.
Don't tell her; just be mum.
Her pulses, which had been languid enough in the stuffy little parlor at the back of the shop, now galloped fiercely.
I can't tell you how splendidly I have planned things.
Kathleen and Grandfather Craven 281 XXV.
"_P.S._--You can name the place by pinning a note under my desk.
There was a look of business and animation throughout the whole place: it was like a hive of bees.
Your parents met in India; they fell in love, and married.
Now I can do what I like with you all." "You certainly can," said Susy Hopkins.--"We are devoted to our queen, aren't we, girls?" "We have fallen in love with her on the spot," said Rosy Myers.
In her tiny house on the common four miles away firing was scarce, and food was scarcer.
Then I was told that a lot of the girls were foundation girls, and they weren't as rich as the others, and they were somewhat snubbed.
She is coming to London, and she wants me to see her.
I allow--" "Oh, I know," said Kathleen.
"Go on," exclaimed Hannah Johnson--"go on and tell us what you want.
It was silly of her, I will own, not to think of the police sooner; but she's gone to them to-day, ordered by me to do that same." "That was thoughtful enough of you, Tom, and I don't object to giving you a morsel of the stalest cake.
You must tell me which is your window." "I sleep in the north attic.
"By then I shall have drawn up the rules.
It is a sweet little locket, and I might save up money enough to have it gilded over.
"What about?" said Clara Sawyer.
"I must insist on my society adhering to it.--Ruth Craven, why are you silent?" "Because I earnestly wish I had not joined.
Shall we go in now and set to work?" "You are an extraordinary girl," said Cassandra.
I expect we'd be expelled." "Then that proves it.
Never mind now; don't look so worried.
Yes, go for it, dear; it won't do you any harm." Ruth wrapped an old shawl round her head, picked up a jug, and went off to the nearest public-house.
And Ruth Craven is really one?" "She is, miss.
For some day she would be mistress of Carrigrohane Castle; some day she would be a great lady on her own account.
Her iron-gray hair, her false teeth, her prominent nose, and her rather cruel steel-gray eyes made themselves felt all down the long room.
And I have done it, Tom--I have done it.
Her eyes filled with tears.
But I want you more than anybody else.
She's a regular out-and-out beauty." "I know her," cried Ruth Craven.
"It must be a good way from here.
I only see how the matter looks to me, and how it would have looked to father, and how it looks to grandfather.
"I will be back in a minute," said Susy.--"Aunt Church, here they are, and I know you will give them welcome." "I am proud to do that," said Mrs.
Perhaps there were worse things than that.
"No" she said, hanging her head.
You know there are two of them.
Nothing could be quieter than her attitude; she did not show a trace of emotion.
And won't Aunt Church be pleased?" "Tell her that if she wants to get one of the little almshouses she had better oblige us as far as she can," said.
"If I could always be like this, nothing would matter," she said to herself.
I have the straight window, and you have the bay.
Come into the garden; I want to talk to you." Ruth looked full round at her companion.
It seemed to Kathleen now, as she lay on her bed, kicking her feet impatiently, and ruffled her beautiful hair, that the thing had come to pass in a flash.
I must tell you all about our scheme.
Now to Kathleen the fact of being interviewed by Miss Ravenscroft only caused a sense of annoyance, and unwonted irritation; Ruth was surprised, partly delighted and partly afraid; but Cassandra, whose father had been a teacher, and who lived all her life in the scholastic world, considered it an honor almost too great for words that she should be specially interviewed by so great a person as Miss Ravenscroft.
I will just say that I know but that I can't tell.
She is very tired; she gets so little rest at night." Kathleen went slowly home.
Of course, she's only going to give tea to Miss O'Hara and Miss O'Flynn--I haven't seen that lady--and yourself and Tom.
We are the twelve members of the Cabinet, and there are about twenty girls who are our sort of standing army.
Tears filled her tired eyes as she thanked God for her good children.
All through the walk Susy chatted for the benefit of her companion.
He died, poor fellow, shortly after you were born.
As Susy Hopkins was running home helter-skelter--for she wanted to get her lessons done in order to be fully in time for the meeting that evening--she met Ruth Craven.
But what about the gloveless little hands and the untidy neck and throat?
"Can't you tell us, Kathleen," she said, "how to get Ireland into England--how to introduce what is good of Ireland into England?
You can manage it quite easily." Kathleen did not wait for any further discussion, but ran out of the room.
There is to be a meeting of the governors at four o'clock this afternoon--a special meeting, convened in a hurry in order to look into this very matter.
Miss Mackenzie was between sixty and seventy years of age; she always dressed in the severest and most old-fashioned manner, and wore her iron-gray hair in ringlets on each side of her head.
See if I don't." CHAPTER XX.
There were six governors, and they were all ladies.
He had rather shallow blue eyes and a wide mouth, but his whole expression was honest and full of fun.
I can fancy I am back in old Ireland." Mrs.
"No, Kathleen, not even for your sake.
"You have been sent here to learn.
"My bark is worse than my bite," said old Mrs.
I am twice as happy a girl as I was before Kathleen O'Hara came to the school." At school next day the members of the new society looked a little conscious.
We make a great fuss about them.
He kept a rather wild establishment, however.
She was so occupied when her mother came in.
You don't look well." "I am quite well," answered Ruth; "but I don't think I'll be able to come back with you to-day, Cassie." "Oh, what a pity, dear!
"Well, good-bye for the present.
Hopkins, and I want to see Susy.
I wish you knew what a dull evening I have just been living through--taking care of a tiny, very dull little shop.
"I should like that which would make me give _my life_ if necessary," he had said; and her grandfather had said, "Sometimes when you come out on the right side of the ledger it means giving _all_ that you possess." Ruth could scarcely see the faces which rose up like a great ocean beneath her, but she remembered her father's words very distinctly.
"How prim and proper every one looked in the school to-day!" she said.
"But I suppose you have done everything for the best, Tom, and I must go around to the butcher's for a little addition to the dinner." Mrs.
Help me now into the parlor.
"I don't want her to get in, I can tell you, mother; and when Kathleen and I were out I told Kathleen that she was a great deal too rich.
It seemed to her that her soul and Susy's had met at that moment, and had saluted each other like comrades true.
I don't think you will be allowed to be absent." "Allowed!" said Kathleen.
He don't mind a word I say, so will you talk to him, aunty?" "But he can't be in the yard without being seen; you say that they are bringing lamps and will make the place as bright as day." "Yes, but he will be in the sty with Brownie; and he as good as said he'd give her a pinch to make her squeal." "Oh, indeed!
She brought it to me, and I now hand it to you ladies for inspection." The little silver heart-shaped badge was passed from one lady to another.
She ran into the kitchen and suggested to Maria that she should help her to toast the bread.
If the ladies of the school and those awful governors were to come along and to see a boy in the midst of forty girls, I do believe we'd all be put in prison.
I joined it at first--I can't quite tell you how--but afterwards I left it.
"So we are without her, girls," continued Kathleen.
"What is the matter with you?--Kathleen, do keep your temper.--Alice, I am sorry something has annoyed you so much." "It is past speaking about, mother.
What have you to do with a young lady like Miss Kathleen O'Hara.
when he lay dead on the field of battle he came very much out on the right side, to my thinking.
At the bottom of the valley was a straight road, and at each side of the road were neat little houses--small and very proper-looking.
No one need be dull who has the privilege of listening to two Irishwomen who have been parted for some time talking their hearts out to each other.
"Well, it has been a dull sort of thing altogether," said Clara Sawyer.
They knew well that if they were discovered they would run a very great chance of being expelled from the school; for although they were day scholars, yet integrity of conduct was essential to their maintaining their place in that great school which gave them so liberal an education, in some cases without any fees, in all other cases with very small ones.
There was no need to hurry.
Just then her mother came in.
I can tell the boys about it.
"We have every reason to be proud of Cassandra Weldon.--And so she, this charming and excellent Cassandra Weldon, is your friend, little Ruth Craven?" "She has been extremely good to me, madam.
Special arrangements were made more than a hundred years ago by the founders of the school that they should receive an education in every way calculated to help them in life; the influence to which I allude undermines these good things.
Tennant, and even Susy, although she's not up to much, and two or three other girls--but I only _love_ you.
"I will think it over.
Kathleen rushed to the door and flung it open.
Finally, with flushed cheeks and a very proud expression on her face, she tripped downstairs.
As she hurried her steps she saw Ruth Craven, the pretty foundation girl, walking in front of her.
The tears were still wet on her cheeks.
I know she has, because I have heard it from one or two of the girls." "But what mystery?
Meanwhile Kathleen was running along the road.
We must hope for the best." "And if it is let," said Kathleen suddenly, running up to the old lady and whispering in her ear, "I'll get Dad to send me a cheque, and you shall have it, so you won't lose one way or the other." This whisper of Kathleen's was very soothing to Mrs.
Come forward in a body at once." What was there in the young voice that impelled?
Hopkins stood, looking very pale and perplexed, in the parlor.
What's the good of making ourselves melancholy on a night like this?" "If I were expelled," said Clara Sawyer, "I should leave Merrifield.
I ought to be doing my own work," she said.
They are very difficult, you know, and you promised that when I went to the Great Shirley School you'd never interfere with my lesson hours." "I did say so, and of course I don't mean to interfere; but this is a special case." "Can't Tommy go and stand in the shop?
Church, Tom was nowhere to be seen.
"Now for a jolly time," said Kathleen.
But I doubt me, now that the thing seems so near, whether I shall like the crossing.
KATHLEEN HAS A GOOD TIME IN LONDON.
"How do you do, Miss O'Hara?" she said.
But as to thinking of giving up girls whom I meant to help, and will help, I wouldn't do it for twenty Miss Ravenscrofts." She stood at the door of the house; then a sudden idea struck her, and as she saw the girls; filing out of the school, she crossed the common and met Susy Hopkins, her satchel of books flung across her shoulder.
It is extremely awkward, and I feel very miserable about it." "You look it; and yet it isn't your affair.
It would be a very great pleasure to me if I saw you presented with a musical scholarship." "Would it?" said Kathleen, glancing at the thin and careworn face of the music teacher.
She was fond of her own companions, but she could not bear the foundation girls.
She had a beautiful melodious voice, which had, of course, not yet come to maturity.
People turned to look at them as they sped upwards.
I mean to prove that I am every bit as good as a paying girl.
"With all my heart," said Rose.
There were houses everywhere--not a scrap of real country, as she expressed it, to be found.
I do not require you to betray your companions; I do not even ask their names.
It is my room as well as yours." No answer.
She stood still for a minute.
You think it is beneath me, perhaps; but I am a lady from a castle, and at Carrigrohane Castle we often do this sort of thing when the hands of the poor maids are full to overflowing." The cook, a sandy-haired and sour-looking woman, began by scowling at Kathleen; but soon the girl's pretty face and merry eyes appeased her.
"Child, I don't want to doubt you--nobody who knows you could do that--but it will mean ruin to poor Susy and to many and many a girl at the Great Shirley School.
Kathleen, on her part, was looking for Ruth Craven.
I will ask her to walk home with me to-day and have tea.
She would not only wear it, but she would delight in it; but nothing would induce her to take it if she thought you had given it." "Then don't let's tell her.
Let me alone now." She gave a portentous yawn.
It isn't often she has anything of that kind to eat; she lives very penuriously, you know, mother." "Well, I suppose I can fling in the sausages.
"I suppose I must stay down here and give up my supper.
Ben heard her, came and sat down on an ottoman not far off, and began kicking his legs.
Then somehow all the girls felt ashamed of themselves, Kathleen slightly more ashamed than the others.
Naylor sobbed quite audibly, and took hold of Ruth's hand, and even kissed it.
"It is the most beautiful thing I ever saw in my life," she thought.
"She is our head girl." "She is; and she is not proud, and she is--oh, so kind!
Ruth was quietly although shabbily dressed; but she had on gloves, a neat hat, and a neat necktie.
A slight frown came between her brows.
"I mean this, my dear, that my husband and I will see you seven back to your home, wherever it is." Kathleen burst out laughing; then she looked very grave, and her eyes filled with tears as she said: "But wouldn't mother approve of it?" "If your mother is the least like me she would not approve of it; she would be horrified." "I don't think the lady can see us home," here remarked Clara Sawyer, "for we live at Merrifield, a good long way from London." Again the lady and her husband had a talk together, and then she suggested that they should take the girls back with them to Charing Cross and put them into their train.
A moment later the servant returned.
Is that why you look so pale and excited and distressed?" said Cassandra.
She put her hand to her ear.
"You go to our school, don't you?" she said.
She put on her plainest hat and a little reefer coat which looked neat and substantial.
She was accompanied by quite a tail of girls: one hung on her right arm, another on her left; a third danced in front of her; and other girls followed in a thick procession.
But the school does more than that.
One or two of the teachers would be the best.
She looked up as though moved to say something.
Cassandra now changed her position, and found herself within a yard or two of Ruth Craven.
My opinion is that schoolgirls ought to be modest, and attentive to their books, and not thinking of giving themselves airs.
"Why do you bother yourself about them?" she asked.
Church had a memory and, as she believed, a grievance.
I can't help saying, Miss Mackenzie, that it would be a very terrible thing, and would, I believe much injure the school, if a girl like Ruth were expelled.
It did not occur to her for a minute that he would not be faithful to her, but she was afraid that others might notice his extraordinary and perturbed expression.
Nobody need know; we will be far too careful for that.
Weldon, speaking with kindness, and looking with eyes full of interest at the handsome, striking-looking girl.
I mean to be a lady, as good as the best.
HIGH LIFE AND LOW LIFE.
She was admired rather than passionately loved by her companions.
She was dashing about, putting plates and cups and saucers anyhow upon the board.
One was called Kate Rourke; she was a girl of fifteen years of age, showily dressed, with flashing eyes, long earrings in her ears, false jewellery round her neck, and a smart, rather shabby hat, trimmed with a lot of flowers, placed at the back of her head.
He is never troubled on account of the Land League or anything else, and Kathleen will have lots and lots of money.
If there was to be a fray, she desired nothing better than to be in the midst of it.
"She is no more a lady than I am." "Indeed she is," said Kathleen.
I don't wish to be good at all to-day.
I will take off your shoes, poor dear; I have brought your slippers down on purpose, and you are to have your tea at this little table.
A few doors down the street Susy Hopkins was waiting for Kathleen.
"But, after all, my naughtiness needn't make that stupid old Alice late for her darling lessons." She scrambled off the bed, drew back the bolt, and returned to her old position.
"We must ask the way, of course," was Ruth's answer.
"She is much too interfering, and she is frightfully stuck-up.
"How old are you, Miss O'Hara?" the English teacher, Miss Dove, had said.
I left it entirely for my own benefit.
"She wouldn't tell." "Of course she wouldn't.
"Mother," she said, "I don't mind a bit about the winter dress; and if my boots are neatly patched and well blacked every day, I dare say I can do with them a little longer.
I will give it to you, cook.--And, Maria, I've got a little toque for you.
Why did you come to a horrible place like this?" "But I like it," said Mrs.
Her hair was tossed in wild confusion about her head and shoulders; it tumbled also over her forehead, and made her eyes look more dancing and mischievous than ever beneath its heavy shadow.
I cannot make that promise.
"It is all very fine for you," she said.
Occasionally they looked behind them; sometimes they started at an ordinary shadow, thinking that a policeman at least would be waiting for them.
"Dave gobbled up his sausage and his sardines," she said.
The scholarship examination takes place in six weeks now, and if I am to have any chance of getting through I must not idle a single moment.
I must be off or I'll be getting into a terrible scrape." CHAPTER XIX.
In pleasing me you will please the governors of the school, and doubtless be able to help yourself and your mother, a most worthy lady, in the long run." "I am very much obliged to you," said Alice.
Cassandra heard her, but she took not the slightest notice.
She is one of the foundation girls, but some of the girls who are not foundationers have singled her out and been specially good to her." "Eh, eh!
I want to find Ruth Craven.
"It is tiresome that I cannot show it.
"Of course--of course her grandfather is right.
"I tell you what it is," he said.
After supper she went with David into the old loft over the tumble-down stables.
Have you had bad news?" "Yes, mother," answered Alice.
How many of those forty can be squeezed into this room?" "Let me think," said Susy.
"But now, with all these silly gewgaws, you will be worse titan ever.
But when all the news had been told, when the exact number of dogs had been recounted, the cats and kittens described, the fowls, the goats, the donkeys, the horses, the cows enumerated, it came to be Aunt Katie's turn to listen.
He stood in front of his sister now and said: "What's the matter?
Weldon came out to meet the two girls as they entered the pretty little cottage.
By-and-by Miss O'Flynn called the two girls to her side.
The doors of the school were now thrown open, and the girls disappeared by their special entrances.
She belongs to them, and she likes that good-for-nothing, pert little Susy Hopkins!
And you won't mind, old lady--say you won't mind--leaving me the microscope when you cross the briny?
On the contrary, they were pleased with the way lessons were done, exercises gone through, and work accomplished.
Of course I'll go.--- You will come with me, won't you, Alice?
The girls seldom returned for afternoon school, generally doing their preparations at home.
I have something to say to you." Ruth's face, until Susy touched her, had been looking like a piece of heaven itself, so calm and serene were the eyes, and so beautiful the expression which lingered round her lips.
Presently she and Cassandra were crossing the common arm-in-arm.
"I have got your ticket for you," said Susy.
The great bell rang, the doors of the school were flung wide, and the girls, Ruth amongst them, entered.
I know what I will do," said Susy.
Oh, what a heavenly, delicious tea!
"Ah, aunty!" said Kathleen, "this is good.
Now then, dear tired one, eat and rest." Mrs.
Hopkins was so relieved to get the money that she never thought at all of the terrible tax it would be to return it.
"But then, of course, you know--" "I know what?" "Oh, nothing.
He was only thirteen, and up to the present no pretty girl had ever taken the slightest notice of him.
I wish you wouldn't go out so much in the evening, Susy; it does make it so hard for me.
One or two of the girls glanced round at Kathleen in amazement.
She'd never forgive me.--You can tell Miss Ravenscroft, Alice, that my aunt has come to see me, and that I have been obliged to go to town.
"It's in real downright delight I am.
It isn't worth while, Alice.
I never saw such a change in any one as what took place in your aunt after she had seen her." "Well, mother, you know what it is all about," said Susy.
She said you are certain to get into most serious, terrible trouble, for the governors will on no account depart from their firm resolve to expel you from the school.
"You will know when you find yourself there; and there is not a moment to lose." So Kathleen, impelled by a curious power which seemed to drive her whether she will it or not, opened the door of the great central hall and entered.
I ain't, I can tell you; I am quite a poor body.
When I noticed that Kathleen O'Hara had a disturbing influence over the girls I caused further inquiries to be made, and I then made a discovery which distressed me very much.
Now it so happened that Susy, just when the tramp stole in, had gone upstairs to fetch a fresh exercise-book.
That's right, old woman." "Very well, old man," she replied, and she pushed the table towards him, put the account-books thereon, and left the room.
Yes, she has arranged it absolutely.
It is not very easy to know the head-mistress; the girls know her up to a certain point, but personal friendship as between one woman and another cannot quite exist between a little girl and her head-mistress.
Well girls, we'll have to run a certain risk.
Ta-ta for the present." Mary turned to the left, and Alice continued her walk.
You can't think how comfortable they are.
Ruth mustn't love anybody in the school very, _very_ much except me.
"They will all hear of it safe enough," said Susy.
"He's a good boy, and the moral of his grand-uncle; and I'll leave him that microscope.
The next moment she had left the room.
I should like you to see her.
"This is what I promised," she said; "and there is a note inside.
It would be a pity to harden her or hold her up to public disgrace.
Part of her power lay in her potential attitudes, in the possibilities which she seldom, except on very rare occasions, exhibited to their fullest extent.
Now, if I was rich like Kathleen, wouldn't I have a gay time of it?
On her way back Florence Archer suddenly joined her.
She's overworked, and that's the truth." Kathleen saw that she was annoying Alice, and proceeded with great gusto to expand her theory with regard to Mrs.
Kathleen and Aunt Katie O'Flynn laughed and almost shouted in their mirth.
It may even be necessary to call a meeting of the Board of Governors.
The rest of the foundation girls at first determined that they would leave her with her fine friends, but when Kathleen insisted on Ruth's joining the secret society of the Wild Irish Girls, they were obliged to submit.
As to Miss Ravenscroft, I have never even seen her." "And who is she, darling?" "The head-mistress, and no end of a toff." "What's a toff, dear?" "It's a slang word they use in stupid old England." "I don't admire it, my love.
Listen to the little woman," said the old man, much pleased and interested by her words.
It doesn't want us, you foundationers and me, to have our fun--our little bit of innocent fun." "Very mean of it!" said one or two, while the others groaned.
The mistress had again to come forward and ask what was wrong.
"Even suppose your aunt had cried," she said, "your duty was to me as your head-mistress." "Please," said Kathleen, "I did not think it was.
Susy saw that she could have her own way, and as soon as dinner was over, without even waiting to help her mother to put the place in order, she started on her walk.
The mere fact of her defying my authority and refusing to come to see me when she is summoned, shows that she is insubordinate as far as this school is concerned." Alice sat very still.
But, after all, was she quite happy?
There are several members, and she herself is the leader.
I'll prove to her that I defy her.
She is so sweetly pretty, too, and such a lady." "Well, dear, her mother was a real lady; and her father was educated by my dear husband, and was in the army." "It doesn't matter if her father was a duke and her mother a dairymaid," said Kathleen with emphasis.
Susy suddenly put in her appearance.
"Let them say." "Well, that's what I think; and I dare say half of it is untrue," said little Janey Ford.
Yet it don't matter to me.
We will return to that point later on.--Why did you leave the society?" "I did so because I wanted to join a scheme proposed by a girl who was not a foundationer and not a member of the society.
She had no hat on, and no jacket.
Kathleen, who was standing not far away, suddenly darted forward and stood within a foot of the two girls.
I have only just crossed the cold sea.
What about my almshouse?" Miss O'Flynn looked rather indignant.
I didn't go to the pit when I went with uncle.
I do wish some strong influence could be brought to bear on her.
When Alice came back that evening Kathleen was sound asleep in her little bed, dreaming of Carrigrohane and the old home.
I am ever so sorry that I kept you out of your part of the room; I won't do it any more.
A woman had called for a penn'orth of paper and an envelope.
Clara Sawyer, a fair-haired little girl about fourteen, with a heavy fringe right down to her eyebrows, completed the trio.
"Don't you think it is rather mean," she said, "to give me up when you promised to belong to me--to give me up altogether and to go with those dreadful, proud paying girls?" "It isn't that," said Ruth, "and you know it.
It is wrong for the girls of the Great Shirley School to absent themselves without due reason." "Well, I have a headache.
You are too white altogether, Ruth.
AUNT CHURCH AT DINNER AND THE CONSEQUENCES THEREOF.
You can be a _great_ friend of mine." "Oh, I don't mind," said Ben.
Is it really arranged that she is to come?" "Yes, of course it is.
Hopkins in an affectionate voice.
Would you greatly mind coming back with me after school, just to see him for a minute?
"There are a deal of funny things whispered about your school just now," he said.
Perhaps I am wrong, perhaps I am right, but I feel happy.
Presently she shouted Ruth's name, and Ruth was obliged to stop.
It was about those almshouses, but--" "Look here, child; you tell me first, and then I'll consider." "No, no," said Susy.
Don't you know for yourself that you are my affinity--my chosen friend, my beloved?
How it came to pass it was impossible to tell.
There was a sort of buzz or whisper going on in their midst.
But Kathleen stood serenely on the ground, and glanced up at the window from which she had let herself down.
The mischief in her dark eyes, too, but added to her charm.
You do look tired, and tired you will go on looking until I take you to Carrigrohane to rest you and to feed you with good milk and good fruit and good eggs and good cream.--Now then, boys, lift up that trunk.
It's all very well to be on the foundation, but there are limits.
She entered the great school, and knocked at the front entrance.
Why do you ask such a strange question?" "I shouldn't think you would wish to; but there is no accounting for what some people can live through." "Alice, what do you mean?" "What I say." "Explain yourself." "No." "Is there anything very awful going to happen at school?" "You will find out for yourself when you get there." "Dear me!" said Kathleen; "you look as if the deluge was coming." "And so it is," said Alice.
Now, what do you mean?" "I say I will give you my message if you will forgive mother." "Then I won't.
She has got a beetle's wing, mother, mounted on glass, and when you gaze down at it it seems to be covered with beautiful feathers, as long as though they were on a big bird.
Maria is making fresh tea now in the kitchen.
The great school was built, and has for generations helped many girls who otherwise might not have been able to earn their own bread.
"What can this mean?" "I can throw some light on the subject, but not much," said Miss Ravenscroft.
Go on; you are not stupid, are you?" "No, Miss Mackenzie," said Ruth, "I am not stupid; and I am very, sorry indeed to seem rude, but I cannot answer your questions.
Expel me, but keep her, for she will be the flower of your school, the greatest ornament, one you will talk of in the dim years of the future.
I'd made up my mind not to think of it, and now you have forced me to say it.
But not only should the great lady of Carrigrohane love her Irish friends, but men and women, both youths and children, but she should love others who needed her help.
I'll leave school to-morrow if you don't let me work for you just the same as ever." Mrs.
With the exception of yourself we are all English girls." "Yes," said Susy suddenly; "and we have very bad times most of us.
"You will--you will, dear Mrs.
It isn't a question of choice; it is a question of necessity.
I must go on now, but I feel somehow----" "What?" said Susy, with some impatience.
Dave, you are a treasure; you are a darling; you are everything that is exquisite." It was Alice's place to pour out the tea.
"Just because you happen to be pretty, they take you up.
She said she wouldn't be at all long getting ready." "She is not in her room, mother.
She stood quiet for a minute or two, and then she went slowly upstairs.
"They have been very good to her; but that Irish girl whom I told you about, she started a society--no special harm in itself--at least it didn't seem harm to the girl I have been telling you about, and she joined it.
I hear Tom pushing Aunt Church in at the gate; I know he is doing it by the creak of the bath-chair.
Kathleen passed through on her way across the common to Mrs.
"Now what are we to do?" said Kathleen.
But Kathleen O'Hara, bad as she is, cannot endure this last insult.
Of course, we can't tell you to a certainty whether the house is still to be had, but I didn't hear that it was let.
I wish I could go back to mother and to my dad.
She went upstairs, turned the handle of the door, and spoke.
She had dropped asleep immediately.
She hated Kathleen for having humiliated and annoyed her; and she went off to Cassandra's house knowing that she would be late, and determined not to say one good word for Kathleen.
It contained the badges of the new society.
You might think me a little rude not to come to you when you sent for me, but Aunt Katie would have been hurt--terribly, fearfully hurt.
If you suppose for a moment that your wild Irish girl can stand much of this sort of thing, you are fine and mistaken, and you can tell the mother so.
Ruth brought him over the pack of books somewhat unwillingly.
"It's a kiss I'm going to give you, my beauty," she said.
And she will; I'm sure she will.
"The house was bad enough before, but now she will make things past bearing." Alice went downstairs to the sound of a cracked gong.
"She may snub you as much as she likes, but you have got me to cling on to." "And you've got me, too, Kitty," said Clara Sawyer.
You see for yourself, Kathleen, that I can't refuse it.
She should make as many people as possible happy.
It seems scarcely fair, for I must say that I don't like Kathleen.
Ruth's very steady eyes were raised; she fixed them on Miss Mackenzie.
She never saw me, and ran on down the passage.
My room is on the second floor; we won't wait for the lift." Kathleen took Miss Katie O'Flynn's hand, and they ran merrily and as lightly as two-year-olds up the stairs.
"Oh, I think--I think I love her still.
And I am sure you will join me, mother darling, in asking Miss O'Hara to stay, too." "But Miss O'Hara doesn't want to join either you or your 'mother darling,'" said Kathleen in her rudest tone.
She said in a deferential tone: "I have come to you, from Kathleen O'Hara.
He rubbed it lovingly against his freckled cheek, held it until it got warm in the palm of his hand, and then put it back in his pocket and jingled it against a couple of pennies which were its only companions.
"Do you greatly object to shutting the window?" she said to Kathleen.
I am glad you have got brothers, Alice.
Immediately after school that day Cassandra held out her hand to Ruth.
There's your mother and David and Ben and the two servants.
Ruth spoke in her gentle tones.
"Aunt Katie has written about it already, and I will write to-night.
She has declared her intention of being naughty.
They have a happy time." "I am sure they have, miss." "Yes, they have a very happy time.
I can't think how the money was stolen." "Why don't you put it into the hands of the police?" said Tom.
Is it true that you have encouraged certain girls in this school--" "Oh, I encourage all the girls, I know.
It would take her a quarter of an hour, running most of the way, to reach the old quarry, and she must have three or four minutes to dress.
"You can't possibly go back--neither you nor my sweet pet Kathleen.
Miss O'Hara has gone into this with her eyes open; and she is rich, and what is disgrace to her in this little part of England, when she herself lives in a great big castle in Ireland, and is a queen, lady, and all the rest?
No, no; I may pick up a few smatterings, or I may not, but there is one thing certain: I mean to make a friend of you, Ruth--yes, a great big bosom friend.
"I have had very good reports of you from Miss Purcell and Miss Dove and others; you will probably be in the sixth next year." "I hope so; it will be a very great delight to me." Alice trembled and colored, looked down, and then looked up again.
But what I want to say now is this.
The room was in darkness.
Now her anger was roused.
And I'd bring you back again in the evening.
What time does your grandmother expect you home?" "Oh, I don't know.
Miss Ravenscroft did resume it.
I am up to no end of mischief.
The leaves are not quite so brown as I should like.
"I'll tell Miss Kathleen that she is to be at Aunt Church's house quite half-an-hour before the rest of the girls, so that aunty can have her talk with her and arrange about the almshouse, and also that Kathleen and Miss O'Hara may have their meal in comfort.
There are few people good enough for you." "To think of her gives me a headache," continued Cassandra.
"Everything is going splendidly," she said to herself.
Now that's the whole of it for to-night.
he has plenty of money, and I don't much care," replied Kathleen.
Will you sit by me and tell me about your home?" Kathleen certainly would not have believed her own ears had she been told an hour ago that she would end her first fit of desperate naughtiness by darning stockings for the Tennant boys.
Do you think I am utterly selfish, Mrs.
Alice Tennant, however, sometimes preferred the quiet school to the noisy life she lived with her brothers at home.
God never forsakes those who trust Him." "Mother," said Susy suddenly, "I hope you will be able to spare me this afternoon.
I wonder if you would." Ben had been very cross with Kathleen when she had knocked to him and David from the dining-room window, but he was not cross now.
Church received them figuratively with open arms.
She had all her life been so abundantly supplied with clothes that, although she loved to array herself in fine garments, the want of them in others never attracted her attention.
"Take my arm, won't you, Ruthie?
"I have had a cold for the last few days.
"Let's go out." "But I--I can't." "I must, then.
This arrangement about meeting one another had been suggested by Kate Rourke, who knew a good deal about theatres, and who also knew how dangerous it would be for so many girls to be seen at the station together; but dressed quietly, and just dropping in by couples, nobody would remark them.
No tears shook her little frame, but there was a storm within.
If their frolic was not discovered, all would be well; if it was, it would be ruin--ruin complete and absolute.
I always was keen for book-learning." Mrs.
You haven't forgotten the water-cress, have you?" "Here's a great bunch of it.
She could not, of course, stock it as fully as she would have liked; she could never extend her connection beyond mere stationery, sealing-wax, pens, and a very few books, and Christmas cards in the winter.
It was noble of Cassandra to offer it, and I--I accepted it, Miss Ravenscroft.
I am obliged to you, little girl.
"I suppose, if you come to analyse it, it is wrong, and not right.
Tennant, "what will Alice say?" "Maria and I don't care twopence what Alice says.
There are some people born that way; I think, after a fashion, I am one of them.
"You are stabbing me--stabbing me.
Oh, I do think she's one in a thousand!
Do you know, in our country we have old ladies something like you.
She's hand and glove with that beautiful Miss O'Hara, and for the sake of the young lady I mustn't get her back up too much." So Susy put the kettle on to boil, and then resumed her place opposite Mrs.
She was mad about the money, and nobody could have been nastier than she might have turned out but for me.
It is singularly fine for a little girl like you.
Be persuaded, dear, and join Cassandra and Ruth, and have a happy time." Kathleen's face had turned crimson.
"I am a bit hard of hearing, my dear; come close to me." "Mother's awfully sorry, but she can't pay you to-day." "Oh!" said Mrs.
If so, it is very thoughtful of her.
She laid it down with emphasis.
She hastily put down her porridge spoon and jumped to her feet.
"Poor child!" thought the good woman.
Can't we have it this week?" "I wish we could," said Susy.
"She is safe to," continued Kate.
But beauty always had a curious effect on the Irish girl, and when she observed Ruth's really exquisite little face, clear cut as a cameo, with eyes full of expression, and watched the lips ready to break into the gentlest smiles, Kathleen said to herself: "It is all over with me.
"I am rather puzzled," she said, "and I want to put a question to you." "Yes, my darling; I am prepared to listen." "I know a girl," said Ruth after a pause--she thought that she would tell her story that way--"I know a girl at school, and she has been kindly treated.
There are three hundred paying girls, and there are one hundred foundationers.
"You seem to have got in a lot of fresh goods, mother," said Tom.
Ben, looking very red and shamefaced, would not meet her eyes.
"I mean," said the little old lady, "that you want to learn all you can--to gain knowledge and wisdom, to learn goodness and forbearance and long-suffering and charity." "Oh, yes," said Ruth, her eyes dilating.
But you have been a rare blessing to us--a rare blessing." "Sometimes I think," said Ruth slowly, "that I have been a great care.
We'll meet to-morrow morning." The girls parted, and Florence went on her way home.
No fear; nothing will go wrong.
The plan is gloryious." The thought of the note and the plan and the little brooch kept Kathleen in a fairly good humor on her walk to school.
"Leave off clutching me by the arm, Alice, my honey, for see my new companions I will.
Do you think I want to copy those nimby-pimby girls over there, or that lot, or that?" "You had better not point, please, Miss O'Hara," said Ruth.
"We mustn't disturb her, Susan," he said.
Susy, in her mother's opinion, was not quite so nice and comforting as she once had been.
Ruth went first, and Kathleen followed.
She went to school in the morning, but as soon as ever lesson hours were over she flew back to her mother's shop.
"Well, I fail to understand her.
I wish I were not, but I can't help myself.
"But she has touched me pretty often.
my people at home made a fine mistake when they sent me to be civilised.
But Susy, who saw no reason why she should bow down before Aunt Church, ate her good dinner with appetite, tossed her little head, and felt that she was making a sensation.
"Examine the drawer for yourself" she said.
"I assure you she doesn't annoy me in the least.
"Now, then, my angels, you come with me," she said, and she caught David by the one hand and Ben by the other, and led her willing slaves into the hall.
"What can it mean?" she thought, and she turned and looked.
What is to be done?" "I can go round to the shop and bring in a quart," said Ruth.
Dalzell, she must not be neglected; I must go out and see her at once." "Then you will be more tired than ever, and I have not done a scrap of good." "You meant very kindly, my dear child, and have given me a delicious and strengthening tea.
We must have the backyard." "What!
Tennant, "you are too good." Kathleen laughed.
We must not go to the quarry to-morrow evening.
"But, oh, what an evening I have had!
I have made up my mind.
"I do wish, mother, you'd try and persuade her," said Alice.
Tennant." Kathleen had now opened a small box which was lying at the bottom of the great trunk.
I must insist on your treating me with respect.
You were always the bit of good luck--on the right side of the balance--always, always." Ruth took the old man's hand and pressed it between both her own.
I have no end of schemes in my head.
Girls, like all other creatures, are susceptible to weather; they do their best work and have their best feelings aroused when the sun shines and the day looks cheerful.
When he finally got up to his attic to thumb over his well-worn lesson-books he had Kathleen's golden sovereign in his pocket.
But with all her fears--and they were many--Kathleen thought again and again of the lady who had girls of her own, and of the gentleman who was both stern and chivalrous, who had the manners of a prince and the look of a gentleman.
It doesn't look out on to the street; and I can't--I can't possibly do it." "You can come down and wait for me in the hall." "How can I?" "When the tired one goes to bed, you can come down.
I have read about it in story-books, and there are cases of it in history; you have one great tremendous fling; you do what is wrong; you have a good--a very good--time, and you know it won't last; you know that afterwards will come--the deluge." "You are a silly!" said Kathleen.
Rules must be made, and these rules at any cost must be obeyed.
I would if I could, but it isn't to be done.
Now then, eat your own dinner, Susy, and be quick.
Perhaps you could try for a scholarship in one of these great colleges afterwards.
Yes, I will come." Kathleen bent towards the music mistress and, somewhat to that lady's astonishment, printed a kiss on her forehead.
Hopkins, and had at one time meant to make him her heir, she had listened to Mrs.
But, my dear, the time has come when Ruth will either have to tell us what she knows or to resign her place in the school." Cassandra's face looked troubled.
It will be all right, Kathleen; don't you fear." Kathleen smiled to herself.
Once she pressed her hand to her side, and Alice, passing her, hesitated and looked back.
Tom is in a hurry to be off to his football." "Oh, bother!" said Susy.
She could be the primest favorite with every one if she only chose.
"There are other houses where I can be entertained and fussed over, and regarded as I ought to be regarded, besides the home of Alice Tennant.
"It is all as right as possible," he said.
Kate just raised her head, looked over the shoulders of her companions, and saw Susy Hopkins darting restlessly about, catching one girl by the sleeve, another by the arm, whispering in the ear of a third, flinging her arm round the neck of a fourth; and as she spoke to the girls they looked interested, astonished, and cordial.
The Irish girl had a healthy appetite, and was indifferent to what she ate.
I'll have more money than any of the other fellows.
Your grandfather looked up at him, and his blue eyes seemed to melt with love and pride, and he said: "'What will you be, my boy?
But it isn't as rosy you are as you used to be.
"Benny," said his sister, "if you have done your lessons, you had better go to bed." "I don't want to go so early.
Tennant returned (she came in looking very hot and tired), it was to see the room tidy, Kathleen seated in her own special chair cobbling the boys' socks as hard as she could, and an appetizing tea on the table.
And yet--I must tell you the truth--I was very nearly declining it." "I don't think I should ever have spoken to you again if you had." "Even so, I was very nearly declining it; for you know I could not have accepted your offer and been friends with Kathleen O'Hara in the way she wants me to be.
In prison she had to wear the ugly convict-dress with the broad-arrow stamped on all her clothes.
"And I can't help going on vexing her." "But what is it?" said Susy, whose curiosity was suddenly awakened.
Kathleen had never been from home before, and Aunt Katie had things to tell her about every person, man and woman, old and young, on the Carrigrohane estate.
"No, no; there is no answer," she said.
And why should there be such a fuss made about Ruth?
"Will you take back the words you said?" "Will I take back what?" "If not the words, at least the thought?
But please clearly understand that I do not want any of your ornaments." "Don't trouble yourself, darling; they were not made for you.
"I always enjoy myself so much more if I am in good company.
Do you like sitting with the little kids?
Do run round the corner and bring in--Oh!
Naylor took her handkerchief and wiped the tears from her eyes; the other governors looked depressed and uneasy.
I'll threaten to complain to you if she doesn't behave." Here Susy laughed merrily.
We will have a rollicking good time--a splendid time.
Here's Aunt Church going, and wondering why you have deserted her during the last hour." "That's just like you, Mary Hopkins," said old Mrs.
"What a wild, undisciplined, handsome creature she is!
Miss Ravenscroft was silent for a minute; then she said gently: "And your friend, Kathleen O'Hara?
She marshaled the little party in two and two, and so conveyed them out of the station.
Don't you think we might make her wear it?" "I am sorry, Kathleen, but you are not getting on very well with Alice.
I have known her grandfather ever since he kept a grocer's shop in the High Street.
You can bring your mending basket, and I will pop you into the arm-chair by the window, and we can consult together over the garments.
Aloud she said: "I am sorry, darling, but I am specially busy, and I really must have my share of the room to myself." "Do open the door, Kathleen," now almost pleaded poor Alice.
"Who in the world can that be?" said Mrs.
We were twin souls before birth; now we have met again and we cannot part.
It was she who gave me that blouse that you seemed to think I had bought with the money which was taken from mother's till.
Kathleen, however, was the last girl to notice any want in her companion's wardrobe.
You are expected on all occasions to uphold the authority of me, your queen.
If it was Alice, wouldn't she be in a tantrum?
"No, no, Kathleen; I will follow you until I drop.
Now to do this we must get all particulars.
But those dull and stupid days were no more.
They were on no account to collect in a mass.
Church hobbled back again into her small sitting-room.
Mother saw me when I was half-way across, and she gave a shriek.
It is more handy for me to say Susan than Hopkins.
She will have to tidy herself, and I must try to persuade her not to put on anything _outre_," thought Alice.
"Don't let any girl think," she said after a pause, "that she is acting nobly by suppressing information which is for the benefit of the school.

I wonder one of your fine friends doesn't pay for you, and so save your position out and out." "I wouldn't allow her to," replied Ruth, her eyes flashing fire.
Susy gave a sharp whistle; the girls started to their feet.
I will tell mother that I am due at an important meeting, and she is sure not to question me; mother is always very kind, and gives me as much liberty as she can." Susy made a great struggle to keep her mind centered on her books, but with all her efforts her thoughts would wander.
We could see ever so much better standing." "No; sit down," implored Ruth.
Amongst these ladies Miss Mackenzie was reckoned as head.
She first of all entered the parlor.
"And I have brought a note-book with me, and if you will dictate them, Kathleen, I will jot them down." "That is easy enough," said Kathleen.
The foundationers were standing in knots talking eagerly to each other.
And they had scarcely left before she found the box which contained the stationery.
The blouse filled her thoughts, otherwise she might have been in raptures over her pretty silver locket and its green ribbon.
They all slink behind the wall, and bob up as she comes by.
I thought you had a cold.
The little old lady was seated in her window; she looked very much, surprised when she saw Susy, and limped to the door and opened it.
Presently Kathleen O'Hara, dressed somewhat extravagantly, and with her blue velvet cap perched upon the back of her golden hair, strolled out of school.
Silver should always be handed on to the eldest son." Susy felt that she was almost worthy of Kathleen's friendship as she regarded the silver forks.
She wondered what Cassandra would say on Saturday.
It is just this: I can't belong to two sides.
All the same, Tom, I wish you hadn't asked old Aunt Church here.
The old lady said that she felt very smart and refreshed, and altogether in a state to do honor to that dear little almshouse.
I don't like any of you.
"I must humor her if I can by any possibility keep my temper," was her thought.
I don't think the governors ought to put any girl in such a position." "They are sorry, but they say they must.
Susy Hopkins, remembering her blouse and her proud position as a member of the Cabinet of the Queen of the Wild Irish Girls, felt for a moment inclined to disobey; but Mrs.
Accordingly, from her store of rich and beautiful garments, she chose the gayest and the most likely to attract attention.
Finally the two found themselves standing, very forlorn and slightly frightened, on one of the big platforms at Charing Cross.
"I don't see how a girl is to be expected to betray her companions." "That is the position, grandfather.
"If you mean to expel Ruth you will expel me," she said.
Ross, the two Misses Scott, and Miss Jane Smyth.
THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE LEDGER.
She asked me what her means were, and I said I believed she has three hundred pounds put by.
You have such strange names in your country.
It doesn't sound at all a respectable sort of name." "I am one," said Susy, beginning to skip up and down.
"I always like going to Aunt Church's; she is very kind to me.
She bowed very slightly and then dropped into a chair, and pointed to another for the girl to take.
They stood about and talked as girls will.
If you ever did, I am that girl." "Oh, my!" said Susy Hopkins.
She was pacing up and down alone; for, most provoking, all her chosen friends had gone off with that young lady.
"And you trace this disgraceful state of things to the advent of the Irish girl?" said Miss Mackenzie.
Church, waving a thin arm and motioning Susy to approach.
Well, Ruth, if that is your mind, I don't know why you care to go in to work, for it will be all over in a day or two--all over--and your fate sealed." "Nevertheless I should like to read that piece of Tasso, and do my work with Miss Renshaw.
We are at school and must mind our lessons.
"It's a fine thing your getting into that school," continued Mrs.
The little sitting-room was a cloud of dust.
I saw that very dull Cassandra Weldon, and I noticed a few companions of hers who were much the same sort.
"I don't know London at all, and I should like to go with you." The two girls now turned into the railway station.
I could scarcely have managed it without this help.
You live with him and his wife, don't you?" "Yes, madam." "And you have been admitted here as a foundationer?" "Yes, madam." "In what class is Ruth Craven, Miss Ravenscroft?" "Ruth is a very diligent pupil.
"Yesterday a meeting of the governors was convened.
I'd like to do it for you, but I don't suppose I shall have time.
I didn't know there was any strict rule about it." "Why, what are you made of, Ruth Craven?" "I thought," said Ruth, "that when we were not in school we were our own mistresses." "To a certain extent, of course; but we have what is called the school character to keep up.
Church keep gazing up at that ugly glass across the room?
Shall we go in?" said Ruth.

Are you a poor girl?
I like you, because you are poor and worried and seem old for your age--although your age is a great one--and because you have to cobble those horrid socks.
She is my aunt, and I wouldn't slight her for all the world.
Had we not better summon Miss Ravenscroft, who will tell us what she means?" A clerk who attended the meetings (also a woman) went away now to summon Miss Ravenscroft.
Tennant an affectionate good-night, nodded to Alice, and left the room.
It looks as if you were--" Cassandra paused, and the color came into her cheeks--"as if you were running away from me." Ruth was silent.
I will give you--- I will give you an Irish diamond set in a brooch if you will help me." This sounded a very grand offer indeed to Susy Hopkins, who lived in the most modest way, and had not a jewel of any sort in her possession.
I will work alongside of you, Ruth--you and I at the same things.
"If you go and stand by the principal entrance, you are safe to see her." "Thank you," said Susy.
You will be sure to come, dear?" "I think not, dear," replied Kathleen in her most aggravating tone.
She thoroughly enjoyed her dinner, and, while she was eating it, forgot all about Susy and the pale-blue cashmere blouse.
The head-mistress at the school and the governors have found out about the secret society.
Kathleen fixed her deep-blue roguish eyes on the good woman's face.
She glanced round her; her dark-blue eyes grew full of sweetness, and there was a look on her face which made the girls for the moment feel that they would die for her.
We can meet at the railway station between five and six, and go off all by ourselves to--But where shall we go when we get to town?" "Couldn't we go to a theatre--to the pit at one of the theatres?" "If only Aunt Katie O'Flynn was with us it would be as right as right," said Kathleen; "but dare we go alone?" "I am sure we dare.
"The boys shall bring it up for me immediately after dinner," she said.
"You are unfortunately in the position of her most intimate friend," she continued, "for you and she live in the same house.
Upstairs was a bedroom for Ruth and a bedroom for her grandparents.
Tom started at about eleven o'clock on his walk to the tiny village where Mrs.
No, whatever the danger, she knew she could keep her own.
She put on a hat trimmed with flowers and feathers, and a sash of many colors round her waist.
"But now, as you are here, I should like to ask you a few questions." "Yes." "What you say, Alice Tennant, will not be--I speak in judicial phrase"--here Miss Ravenscroft gave vent to a faint smile--"used against you.
I am glad to see you, Mr.
Kathleen had been given much by Nature.
"If you will allow me to put you two ladies into a cab, the cabman will take you to the Hôtel Métropole.
"I am shaking and trembling now like anything.
She's very fond of me." "But she's no end of a howler.
"We'd form a crusade for her," Edith had whispered, back.
Ruth got up rather earlier than usual on that Saturday morning.
"But we thought we'd have a bit of supper," said Kate Rourke.
You'd have to be just as fascinating, just as pretty, but different somehow--I mean--" "Oh, do tell me what you mean, and be quick.
Why did she leave her own country?" Ruth was silent.
The sunshiny weather puts heart into them.
Then she blushed; then she laughed; then she said, "Oh, it's quite well." Alice gazed steadily at her.
He burst into the parlor where his mother and Susy were sitting.
Kathleen was all enthusiasm, gay life, valor, daring; Ruth's gentle face and quiet voice gave little indication of the real depth of character which lay beneath.
She opened the bedroom door.
"I don't like Kathleen; I will frankly say so.
Well, I suppose I must give her the message." She hurried her steps as these last thoughts came to her, and presently she stood outside the principal entrance of the little church.
She would get her forty pounds a year when the time came, and go to Holloway College or some other college.
I really can't stay another moment, Mary.
The Poor Tired One 72 VII.
"I am afraid I must go," said Kathleen.
we must hope for the best, I suppose.
But now I am having a jolly time." So Kathleen did enjoy herself, and made so many saucy remarks between the acts, and looked so radiant notwithstanding her very plain dress, that several people looked at the beautiful girl and commented about her and her companions.
"I saw Miss Ravenscroft this morning.
It doesn't matter whether you hear the message I have come to give you or not.
You are a clever girl, Ruth.
"That does sound romantic." Her momentary dislike to Kathleen had vanished.
I think if your aunt was sure and certain to get into one of those almshouses she might do a good turn to you, Susy; and she's sure and certain to help Tom a little.
You are a queer little girl, and not altogether to my taste, but you are no fool." Susy stood silent.
I am going to-night, and I am going all the more surely because you wired to me not to go, and because they are daring to bully dear little Ruth Craven.
Why, you are sort of Prime Minister to the queen." "You don't think it right really, do you," said Ruth--"not from the bottom of your heart, I mean?" "Right or wrong, I mean to enjoy myself," said Susy Hopkins.
"It's golloptious," she said, turning to the child, and then she drummed her fingers once more on the edge of the desk.
I think, on the contrary, that I am very rich.
"There's only one way out.
You look so terribly tired; and I don't think you ought to have this horrible work to do.
She dashed upstairs, and on the first landing she met Mrs.
The forks were real silver; Mrs.
I shall feel proud of myself in it.
How much do you think I'm going to eat, miss?" "I'm sure you are going to be horribly greedy.
Tennant had not been out more than a minute or two before David and Ben came in.
The head-mistress superintended the management of every girl in the school, but she did not show herself except when she read prayers in her deep musical voice morning after morning, or when something very special occurred.
My mother keeps the stationer's shop in the High Street." "To be sure," said Mrs.
Don't be a goose; nip the thing in the bud immediately.--AUNT KATIE." "But indeed I won't," thought Kathleen.
It is past ten o'clock.
"My grandfather and grandmother will be sitting up for me." "Oh, nonsense, child!" said Miss O'Flynn.
I will bring it to you to school to-morrow." "Oh, thank you--thank you, Miss--I forgot your name." "O'Hara--Kathleen O'Hara." "O'Hara is rather a difficult name to say.
"Speak, dear," said Miss Dove in a persuasive tone.
Being an Irish girl, it is quite natural.
I can't go like this, all untidy, and my hair so messy, and my collar--oh, mother, it is nearly black!
There was a slight rain falling, and two or three girls standing in a group raised their umbrellas, but they still stood beside the gates.
There were three windows overhead, and one or two attics in the roof.
"Aristocratic!" cried Kate.--"Hannah Johnson, you haven't given your opinion yet.--And, Ruth Craven, you haven't given yours." "I reserve my opinion," said Ruth.
"Miss Ravenscroft is waiting," said the mistress who brought Kathleen the message.
That's about all." "And Tom will have a pretty keen appetite," said Susy.
Oh, mother, how could you?" "Run upstairs at once, child, and take it off.
"If we are to sleep together we must be orderly." "Orderly, is it?" cried Kathleen.
We must have a nice dinner for her.
"You must hide them," said Kathleen.
"Granny is not very well, and I ought not to have left her, even to have dinner here; but I couldn't help myself." Cassandra brought her friend into the house.
He planted himself right in front of the old lady.
Alice presently took the handle of the door and shook it.
Her grandfather got better; his heart was never broken by the knowledge of that terrible disgrace which the child so feared that she would bring him.
I do feel obliged for your kind opinion of me.
Indeed, if anything, Kathleen had a decided leaning towards the foundationers; and she, Kathleen, was a lady--she belonged to what her mother and Aunt Church called the "real quality." "None of your upstarts," Aunt Church had said, "but one who for generations has belonged to the aristocrats; and they are of the kind who are too great in themselves to be proud.
I want to get into my room; I want to tidy myself.
I want to be quite generous with my lovely things." "Well, do stop talking," said Alice.
She and Kathleen had almost a quarrel as to who was to carry up the tray, but Kathleen won the day; and when Mrs.
She promised us all sorts of things.
I suppose it will come to our all being expelled." "Oh, not a bit of it," said Kathleen.
"Well, all the same, I feel rather anxious.
She was an Irish girl again, sitting close to one of her very own.
She wants you to do something for her." "Me?" said Mrs.
A thief came into the shop and took some of her money, and she is very short of money and very worried.
In one sense she was always a more or less troublesome girl; but where she loved she loved deeply, and from that hour she gave up all thought of rebellion either against the governors or against Miss Ravenscroft.
Just at that moment Alice rushed into their bedroom.
She got up and went to the window.
"In addition to your misdemeanors, I should advise you not to be late for prayers just at present." "Thanks so much!" said Kathleen in a sarcastic tone.
Kathleen was in a low class; she was with girls a great deal smaller and younger than herself.
She is the sort of girl that I could die for.
The untidy table did not trouble her in the least; she was accustomed to things of that sort at home.
I am sorry I am a little late." She walked past them all.
Again this answer was recorded.
But still, she does look pretty when she is asleep." Kathleen had very long and very thick eyelashes and nobly arched brows.
I knew that was at the bottom of it," said Cassandra.
I meant to run away when my affinity would have nothing to do with me." "Really, Kathleen, you are a most extraordinary girl." "Of course I am," said Kathleen.
Don't mind those others; let them stare all they like.
"I am glad you are so tremendously rich that you think nothing of three hundred pounds.
"I wish you wouldn't lie on the bed in your muddy boots." No answer.
"I will go and see grandfather," she said, "and then I must be off to school." She left the kitchen and went into the tiny parlor where the old man was seated.
Be quick!" Susy put out her hand and helped Mrs.
At four o'clock that afternoon the governors of the Great Shirley School met in the room set aside for the purpose.
If Ruth got a scholarship she would indeed be a happy girl, and it was Cassandra's, opinion that, although she had been such a short time in the school, she would have a very good chance if she got a little outside help.
Church edged her chair a little nearer; her beady black eyes seemed to read Susy through and through.
I promised granny." "But listen before you decide.
Short as the time was--not more than six weeks--she had worked havoc in the school.
In future, Kathleen O'Hara, I must insist on instant obedience.
"We shall soon get the remaining forty," said Mary Rand.
Kathleen wondered--she was not sure, but she wondered--if she really did see, or if it was only a dream, a pair of brown eyes looking at her from the station, and the severe young figure and shocked face of Alice Tennant.
Tennant's house, and Susy went slowly back to the High Street and the little stationer's shop.
When a man doesn't attend to his own business, accounts go wrong.
"I think I can manage my own affairs," she added, and then she was silent, not exactly cross, but lost in thought.
"He thinks he can make the instrument speak." "And so can I," said Kathleen.
Of course I am sorry for her, and I quite understand that she doesn't want to disappoint her aunt, but she ought to come with me; she ought, mother.
The person I am most anxious about at present is Ruth: I love Ruth so very much.
"That she did, ma'am," cried Maria.
Well, I will say that I have a good appetite.--You can push me right up to the table, Tom, my boy." Tom did push the old lady into the most comfortable seat.
Sometimes things are past bearing, and yet we are powerless.
"Indeed, if it hadn't been for you, Kathleen, I doubt if any of us would have come." "Well, girls, we can't help it," said Kathleen.
Let us hope that Providence will spare her precious life.
There are a hundred of them at the Great Shirley School, and I am going--No, I can't explain.
"If you have really made up your mind not to improve yourself in the very least, mother had better write to Squire O'Hara and suggest that you don't come back after Christmas." "And Squire O'Hara will decide that point for himself," replied Kathleen.
"Do I love her any longer?" she said to herself.
It is only half-past eight." "I have business, darling--a friend to meet.
The little shop with its gay light and tempting articles of stationery, and books and sealing-wax displayed in the window, were quite to the man's taste.
I am off now, and I need not be back in the house until it is time to dress to go to Mrs.
She's made to dance and joke and laugh, and to have a gay time.
Her mother's name is Mrs.
"I wonder," she said "why you hate me so much?' "Fudge!" said Alice.
Tennant, coming up to her at that moment.
We are poor at home, Miss Ravenscroft.
THE HOME-SICK AND THE REBELLIOUS.
"I will make it up to you.
"And I say there's a great deal of humbug and balder-dash in the world," said Hannah Johnson.
"Five shillings all to yourself; and I won't press your mother about the installment which was due to me yesterday.
They go straight out to their kindred spirits.
I want you to let mother off this month's installment of her debt." "What?" cried Mrs.
Craven, "you heat that plate by the fire.
"You are a good child," she said.
She combed back her luxurious hair and tied it with a ribbon to match the dress.
Hopkins paid the debt which had been due on the previous day.
The warm, nourishing food seemed to choke her; but, all the same, she ate it with resolution." "That's right, dear," said her grandmother.
"I want to read that bit of Tasso over again before Miss Renshaw comes." "No, no," said Cassandra.
"It strikes me it will be all up with us to-morrow--that is, if Ruth tells." "If Ruth tells!
I used to be a Board School girl, but now I am on the foundation at Great Shirley.
RUTH WILL NOT BETRAY KATHLEEN.
"There can't be more than two bedrooms upstairs," thought Susy.
We must put this matter down with a strong hand.
"They're all coming," she said, "and you will have to get them in by hook or crook." "You're enough to deave a body.
"I will watch for you and the beautiful Irish heiress--" "I don't know that she is an heiress." "Well, whatever she is--the bewitching Irish girl--to-morrow morning.
"Just regard me as a necessary evil.
"Send him to me this minute." Susy went out and called her brother.
What I call amateur music can't be allowed here." "Will this be allowed?" said Kathleen.
Years ago it was an old story with him that something had gone wrong with the books; but, dear hearts!
She makes you all love her and then she gets you into trouble." "But getting into trouble for a friend doesn't make you hate that friend," said Ruth.
Ruth felt her gentle heart beat high.
She was able to keep her own counsel, and this last daring scheme was locked tightly up in her heart.
"It's my poor cousin Peggy Doharty.
Anyhow, this is delicious fun, and I mean to go on with it.
But very soon afterwards the welcome bang of the hall door was heard, and the house was free.
Can you let her know?" "Step in here, miss." Alice was shown into a small waiting-room.
Aunt Church at Dinner, and the Consequences Thereof 150 XIV.
"Why, the little old lady seems as young and agile as the pretty niece," said one visitor to another.
I was trying to collect a pound towards your winter things, but this puts a stop to everything." "Mother doesn't know what a lovely blouse I've got," thought Susy.
Good-bye to you, pet; I haven't a minute to lose--Tom--is that your name?--go out and tell the messenger that I will go back with him to Merrifield." "And what about my almshouse?" screamed out Mrs.
_"Rule Two._ If possible, never to quarrel each with the other." This rule also was received with acclamations.
It is--no, it's not nothing, for it is something; but I can't tell you.
To some it is wealth; to others it is a decent competence; to others, again, it is poverty." "Kathleen didn't think much of it, mother." "Well," said Mrs.
Church; "and you ought always to put butter on your bread when you eat honey.
Your mother died at your birth, and you came home to us.
Because, if you do, I will tell the others.
"I'd rather have cold water, please," Kathleen replied.
"Has he gone home, Aunt Church," she asked.
Hopkins." "No, Miss O'Hara; it ought to be to-night.
You are a broth of a boy.
That must be the Thames.
I meant to apprentice her to a good trade when she had gone through her course of work at the Great Shirley; but she will have to be a servant--a little maid-of-all-work--and I think that it would break my heart if she was expelled." "And what do you want me to do, Mrs.
Alice considered them very badly trained.
"She has a great deal that is good in her; she is handsome and rich, very affectionate, and full of spirit." "But what has a girl who is handsome and rich to do in a school like the Great Shirley?" asked Mrs.
The girls were so completely in league with each other, so full of delight over the new amusement which Kathleen had started in their midst, that they had no time to be supercilious or disagreeable to the paying girls, who were left in peace.
Don't you remember that time when we had Norah Mahoney at the school?
She stood up, therefore, at her work, in order, as she expressed it, to save time.
"We want to go to see a lady at the Hôtel Métropole," she said.
"And you have been good to my little lass--my little woman here.
It's my clothes--my sort of a kind of a treasure.
"Well, don't do it again.
She banged-to the door, and standing by it for a moment, drew the bolt.
"Putting aside that question," she said, "the effect on the girls is most disastrous.
Most girls have, haven't they?
It's a sort of cross between a coral and a rose--oh, so exquisite!
"Don't drag my sleeve," she replied crossly.
But it means--oh, such a frightful lot to so many!
The Right Side of the Ledger 308 XXVII.
"It has been brought to our ears that a society has been formed by an Irish girl of the name of Kathleen O'Hara.
The boys went to another foundation school near by; and altogether the family managed to scrape along.
She wore her little school-apron and she kept folding it between her fingers as she stood in the presence of her judges.
I'll be back as soon as I can." David did not notice her disappointed face; he went out immediately, without even going upstairs first.
"And then we must go straight to the theatre," she said, "and stand outside the pit, and take our chance; but we will have time enough for that if we leave Merrifield by the quarter-to-six train." Kathleen noticed that evening that Alice watched her as she moved about the room; that Alice occasionally lifted her eyes and glanced at her when she sat down to read; and when she approached the tea-table and helped herself to tea and bread-and-butter and jam, Alice also kept up that gentle sort of espionage.
As the two girls now entered the house they heard a whistle proceeding from the attic; a cat-call at the same time came from the basement.
She went to the sideboard, filled a glass, and drank it off.
"My visitor and all," she kept saying.
Presently Alice returned to the breakfast-room, and Kathleen now noticed that her eyes were red, as though she had just been indulging in a bout of crying.
Do not approve of your society.
They went upstairs to the bedroom, and then Ben saucily perched himself on the foot of one of the beds; while David, having brought up a hammer and screwdriver, proceeded to lift the lid of the box, which was firmly nailed down.
"Did you buy these things?" she said.
She was desperately, madly lonely.
Kathleen felt a curious tremor run through her, but she did not move a muscle; only when Ruth appeared at the edge of the platform, it was with the greatest effort she could keep herself from jumping up, taking her hand, and mounting the platform by her side.
If the others are in bed, will you come and unlock the door for me when I throw gravel up at your window?
But Cassandra as a rule was perfectly sweet and pleasant to the foundation girls, and this trait in her friend's character annoyed Florence more than anything else.
How nicely he spoke, and how beautiful he looked--how like my dear old grandfather who has been with God for so many years now." There came a loud rat-tat at the front-door.
She was only in debt for the one hundred pounds, which had been lent to her by an aunt of her husband's, an old woman of the name of Church, who lived in a neighboring village about four miles away.
Ruth's Troubles and Susy's Preparations 230 XX.
She glanced at Kathleen with disgust.
"This is a very good and a great school," said Miss Ravenscroft.
"Look for yourself," she said.
Her musical talent very nearly amounted to genius.
She wore a very dark-blue serge dress, and her white sailor-hat looked correct and pretty on her shining brown hair.
Susy had no particular eye for pretty views, or she might have pleased herself with the wonderful tints of the sky, and the autumnal shades which had not altogether deserted the neighboring woods.
Mother said I might ask you." "I wish I could come," said Alice; "but we are expecting Kathleen." "Oh, the Irish girl!
Finally she said: "What are you doing?
If we had either of us fallen we'd have been dashed to pieces on the cobble-stones forty feet below.
Forty people coming into this tiny house, where we can scarcely turn round with more than two in the house!
Oh, I know you are _dead_ tired.
Maria presently came back and the tea-table was laid.
Now, Kathleen, standing in the tiny room, had a certain look of wealth and distinction about her.
She sat down to the table, helped herself to a piece of toast, and spread some butter on it.
She burst into tears now and flung her arms around Ruth's neck.
Hopkins, beginning to count on her fingers, "a pot of strawberry-jam--" "Oh, golloptious!" burst from Susy.
"I can write by post." She crushed the telegram up and thrust it into her pocket.
Ah, then, it's illegant myself will be when you see me next, boys.
You perhaps know to what I allude." "I could not be in the school without having heard rumors of a sort of insurrection which seems to be spreading a good deal," said Cassandra.
But I never knew them.
For the present we will forget last night." "Thank you, madam.
Accordingly Cassandra waited for Ruth outside the school when lessons were over.
"You are always in such a fidget to learn, Ruth.
But I like her; and I like Alice Tennant." "All the same," said Susy, "it is worth sacrificing a little thing to belong to the Wild Irish Girls.
"The whole forty of us will meet you at the station to-morrow night.
Skirts, bodices, blouses, shirts; an evening dress, an afternoon dress, a morning dress--they seemed simply endless.
When I am back again at home I shall play 'The Harp that once through Tara's Halls,' but I can't do it justice here.
But Tom was now making pantomimic signs for refreshments.
Ruth sighed and continued her walk with Kate.
Hopkins, and then turned and continued her walk to the school.
See, Aunt Church; if you look you will believe." Here Susy pulled from the neck of her dress a little heart-shaped locket with the device and name of the society on it.
She caught up her books and started running in the direction of Ruth Craven.
The foundationers who called themselves the Wild Irish Girls had very little doubt what it would mean if their scheme was discovered.
"She's driving me nearly mad." "Your sister is naturally much annoyed, David," said his mother.
"I don't see that I'm bound to submit to your ugly, cruel words.
"Forgive me, Kathleen, but I think we ought to be looking out a train to go back by." "Indeed, and that you won't," said Miss O'Flynn.
My eyes were first opened by the fact that one of our teachers picked up off the floor, just where a certain Clara Sawyer, one of the best and most promising of the foundationers, was sitting, a small locket, evidently a badge.
Well, I can't stay another minute.
There are, I am given to understand, in the midst of this hitherto well conducted and admirable school, a number of girls who have banded themselves together in disregard of its laws, and who have made for themselves laws contrary to the peace-abiding principles of this great school and noble institution: who meet at unseemly hours, who preach rebellion each to the other, who dare to publicly break the laws of the school, and who defy the express wishes of myself as head-mistress and the governors of the school by insisting on continuing their wicked meetings.
"I will go back to town with the messenger, get off to London to-night, and cross in the morning.
Do you know anything about it?" "Nothing absolutely." "But you agree with me that there is a disturbing element?" "I am afraid I do." "It has been traced to Kathleen O'Hara." Alice was silent.
She's coming up, the creature!
I know where Miss Weldon lives.
Mother was out looking after a sick child, and I had to mind the shop.
"I see she is about to heap unhappiness on herself and others.
I will never hear your message." "All right, I will go," said Susy.
Patrick's Day in the Morning." Kathleen trembled.
I have got the most heavenly plan to suggest to you." Cassandra laid her hand on Ruth's shoulder.
Now, mother, don't you call that riches?" "Three hundred pounds!" said Mrs.
"She's no better than the others, and she's very new.
In those days she did not consider herself a lady, nor expect ladies to take any special notice of her.
"Susy," she said the moment they got out of doors, "what is the matter with Ruth Craven?" "With Ruth Craven?" said Susy, who was by no means inclined to waste her time over such an uninteresting person.
Regard what you have to do as an unpleasant duty, and don't consider yourself in any way responsible for being forced into the position which one would not, as a rule, advocate.
Of course, we can't do anything special in the daytime, unless sometimes on Saturday, when we have a whole holiday; but at least; she says, the nights are our own and we can do as we like.
It's extremely displeasing both to David and me." Kathleen laughed.
"What class are you in?" "I don't know.
What about Miss Kathleen O'Hara?" "Aunt Church, you can help Miss Kathleen, and she is worthy of being helped.
But I want to see that beautiful young lady in my cottage, and you will get the money when you bring her.
The next minute Kathleen caught firm hold of the arm of old ivy and let herself down deftly and quickly to the ground.
She found herself getting red and annoyed when the calm, steadfast gaze of Alice's brown eyes was fixed on her face.
She fixed her eyes full on Ruth.
I am going to hunt round for her immediately after dinner.
Weldon will be pleased if you will go in, miss.
"But you must.--Mustn't she, mother?" "You ought to, Kathleen," said Mrs.
Yes, my dear, I hope you will love me, but in the sense of one who is set in authority over you.
And I always was your own boy, wasn't I?
"I got on abominably," said Kathleen.
Church was comfortably established in the easy-chair in the little parlor, with her feet on the fender, and a nice view of the street from the window near by--when her best widow's-cap was perched upon her head, and her little black mitts were drawn over her delicate, small hands--she looked around her and gave a brief sigh of satisfaction.
"We are going to have a glorious time," whispered Susy to Kate Rourke as they made their way to their respective classes.
And all those other women--they seem quite cross with me.
O'Hara, and Kathleen comes to-day.
Oh, it was a good, good time they were about to have!
But Ruth did not sit; she only put one pretty little hand on the back of a chair as though to steady herself.
It is extra good this morning, and there's a drop of cream in that jug which will give it a flavor." Ruth sat down to the table and drew her bowl of porridge towards her.
There was an interval of silence, and then Alice had her reward!
I have no learning, and I never want to have any, and what's more--" "Hush, girls!
It is really most disturbing." "If you would only take poor little Kathleen as she is, you would find her quite agreeable, Alice," was her mother's answer.
You will have to give me your word, and that before you leave this room.
She turned on the gas in the parlor--it was already brightly lighted in the shop--and sat down to her work.
Do you know, Alice, you haven't got at all nice manners.
Your granny has missed you too to-day." Ruth smiled at him and went into the kitchen.
"What are they all doing there?" she said.
Then Cassandra presented the temptation.
"But I tell you what, Aunt Church; Tom's after mischief; he means to witness all the proceedings of dear Miss Kathleen's great society, and we oughtn't to let him.
I think of it at night, and when I wake first thing in the morning I remember it.
He gave a sigh of contentment, drew the lamp a little nearer, and was lost for the time being.
Won't she give us a time now?
Church's direction, and then disappeared.
After a time she came to the door and beckoned to the old man to follow her.
Ask her if she'll be kind enough to give me a week's grace, Tom; that's a good boy.
And you might keep your own little pig if you liked." Mrs.
The intense light made her golden hair shine, and brought out the delicate perfection of each feature; the merry eyes framed in their dark lashes, the gleaming white teeth, the rosy lips were all apparent.
I should like to introduce her to mother." "Well, I never!" said Hannah.
It is whispered in the school that we are found out, and the school, bless it!
For reasons of her own she did not wish to be long there.
Hopkins's most precious store was produced; real silver spoons--from the same source--made their appearance; a few cups and saucers of good old china were added.
I feel almost as jolly as though I were in old Ireland again." She laughed merrily, parted from Susy, and ran all the rest of the way home.
Church about it last Sunday.
I only noticed yesterday that she is remarkably pretty.
Tom Hopkins is part and parcel of this 'ere feast, and the sooner you make up your mind to endure me the better." Susy felt slightly alarmed, but she knew from experience that Tom's bark was worse than his bite; and she trusted to Aunt Church desiring him in a peremptory manner to go when the time approached, and to Tom's being forced to obey her.
Kate was clever, and she meant to try for one of the big scholarships.
There is no false pride about a real lady, girls; and the end of it is that she has a plan to propose--something for our benefit and for her benefit.
Susy marched through the shop, still swinging her satchel.
There wasn't anything to learn.
We'll meet in the quarry on Saturday night, and then we'll make a plan for a great expedition all by ourselves to London in the course of next week." "Oh dear," said Susy, "doesn't it make your heart throb?" "And I want to add," continued Kathleen, "that I will frank you.
As long as I am in England I must consort, I see, with all kinds of people; and if you will make yourself useful to me, I will be good to you." Susy turned and led the way in the direction of Cassandra Weldon's home.
Mean to have a lark with your pretty Miss Kathleen; mean to get a sov.
They wanted a penn'orth of paper each.
A porter was standing on the steps of the hotel.
Her heart beat fast; she clenched one of her hands.
Susy's stockings were coarse, and showed darns here and there; Susy's shoes were rough, and could not altogether hide the disfiguring patches on the toes of each; Susy's skirt was dark-blue serge, fairly neat in its way.
I suppose you'd like to have the box taken up to our room; but I don't think you'll have any time to open it at present.
A little maid, neatly dressed, came to the door.
Her swift feet scarcely touched the ground.
I trust to goodness you are not getting extravagant.
it is a mouthful of a word for me to get round my lips.
She pushed it wider and got in.
Kathleen and her aunt ate while they talked.
But never mind; it is but to look at you to see how beautiful and good you are." "And you are beautiful, too," said Kathleen.
I haven't the slightest influence over her, but you have.
Cassandra Weldon was not the only girl who had taken Ruth up; some of the best and nicest girls of the school began to patronize her.
He raised his trembling hand and placed it on her head.
So the whole thing was settled; mother has been corresponding with Mrs.
Why girls, Miss Ravenscroft and the governors can do nothing to us unless they have proof, and they will have no proof if we are all true to each other.
"My dear," she said then gently, "you are new to the school.
She put her hand on the moth-eaten cushion of the old bath-chair, bent forward, and looked into Mrs.
Then Susy began to observe it.
"I think our home a very pleasant, entertaining place.
The girls ran wildly looking for a third-class carriage.
Will you do what I want?
She then wrapped herself in an old waterproof cloak--for the sunshiny morning had developed into an evening of thick clouds and threatening rain--and went downstairs.
The girl was extremely clever, with a sort of all-round talent which was most remarkable; for in addition to many excellent accomplishments, she was distinctly musical.
How pale and sweet Ruth looked to-day!
"Susan," said the old lady, "while the kettle is boiling you might as well lay the cloth and get out the tea-things." "No, no," said Susy; "I haven't come here to act servant to you, Aunt Church." "You have a very nasty manner, Susan; and whatever the Almighty may mean to do with you in the future, you had best change your tune or things will go ill with you." Susy sat quite still, apparently indifferent to these remarks.
They stopped at the cottage, and a loud knock at the door was next heard.
It's four miles away." "Well, I suppose those who are really interested can walk four miles.
So she did accept it, and--Are you listening, grandfather?" "Indeed I am, little maid.
But to-day she felt cross, and even her music was at fault.
"Free at last," she thought.
She determined to sit with her back slightly turned to Alice, in order not to look into her face.
I never saw such a muddle-headed woman as your aunt Bessie.
"We all agree," said the Misses Scott and Miss Jane Smyth.
I thought my duty was to my aunt." Miss Ravenscroft was silent for a minute.
She lay back in her chair and whistled "Garry Owen" in a most insolent manner.
Anyhow, we will let that lie in the future.
And this dear little girl, one of my chosen friends, Ruth Craven, has come with me." "Ah, now, how sweet of her!" said Miss O'Flynn, turning to Ruth.--"Kiss me, my darling.
Outside the yard at Charing Cross they all climbed on the top of an omnibus, and soon were wending their way in the direction of the Princess' Theater, which Kate most strongly advocated.
I will go round to the police-station this very afternoon and get Police-Constable Macartney to take it up." "But, mother, the thief, whoever he is, has left the place long before now.
It is the safest place you can possibly imagine, for no one will ever look for us there.
I think little Peter is not well; your aunt is afraid he is catching measles.
"Oh, mother, don't!" said the little girl.
I mean to talk to that girl; she's won my heart entirely." Before Alice could prevent her, the Irish girl had sprung forward, pushed a couple of Great Shirley girls out of their places, and had taken Ruth Craven by the arm.
Altogether the breakfast was a noisy one.
There is some mystery afoot, and Miss Ravenscroft has got wind of it.
One of the great ideas of the school was to encourage brave actions, unselfish deeds, nobility of mind.
Kathleen, who had dressed lamps for pleasure at home, knew quite well how to manage them, and when Susy appeared they stood at each end of a wide patch of light.
What have you got to say?" "You are mad with jealousy, and you know it," answered Susy.
She was to go to speak to Miss Ravenscroft in that lady's parlor.
"That's the place!" exclaimed Mary.
He told his schoolfellows that at that moment he lost his heart to Kathleen.
"Now, girls, I intend to present you each with a tiny badge.
It consisted of a stale loaf, some indifferent butter, and a little jam.
But I had never been to a theater, and it was such a tremendous temptation.
I saved and stinted and toiled and got him a commission in the army.
Have you got the pepper and salt handy?
There they sat side by side, and Kathleen told David about her old life.
"I will give you five shillings.
Where does the society meet?
You are no longer a member of the Great Shirley School; you are--" "Hold!" cried Kathleen.
She sat down, helped herself to a thick slice of bread-and-butter, and ate it, while burning thoughts filled her mind.
"You know," said Kathleen, helping herself to a second potato, and fixing her eyes on Mrs.
We must bear with some discomforts on account of that." "I suppose so," said Alice, shrugging her shoulders.
Kathleen had a passion for music; she had never been properly taught, but the soul of music was in her as much as it was in David Tennant.
David went out and brought in a telegram.
She was amazed to see that good woman, as at that hour she was usually busily engaged in her shop.
I am going to meet Aunt Katie O'Flynn.
Let me clutch on to you until they put me into the lowest place in the school." "But why so?" asked Ruth, glancing at her tall companion in some astonishment.
Still, three guineas a week makes an immense difference to me, Alice.
If you have a turn that way I could set you on your legs; I am certain of it.
"Go to bed, dear," called out her parent.
But never mind; I am never one to press what it ain't convenient to return.
Her intuitions were rapid indeed; she could come to startlingly quick conclusions, and as a rule her guesses were correct rather than otherwise.
My name is Kathleen O'Hara, and I hail from the ould country.
"Does the queen mind our looking at her face in turns?" said Kate Rourke.
He took me to a grand stall, and we rubbed up against the nobility, I can tell you." It suddenly occurred to Kathleen that Kate Rourke was rather a vulgar girl.
Her mother kept a fairly flourishing stationer's shop, in one part of which was a post-office.
She pressed close to the old man, took one of his weather-beaten hands between both of her own, and stroked it.
"Maybe you might as well put the kettle on the fire; it takes a good long time to boil.
Church, more and more impressed.
Finally, at the very bottom of the trunk was a little parcel which she refrained from opening while Mrs.
"You must give it up.
You will be sure to see her this evening, won't you?" "Sure and certain," said Susy.
If you butter your bread and don't eat the comb, honey agrees with you as well as anything else." "Mrs.
"You have balanced things a long time ago," she said.
Now all of you girls whom I have named are expected to uphold order--such order as is alone necessary for the Wild Irish Girls.
She'll be in London to-night.
Don't hate me too much; I can't help the way I am made.
Such conduct is so unworthy, so undignified, and so absolutely sinful that there is only one course to pursue.
You shall be desperately proud of me; and so shall granny, although she doesn't hold with much learning." "But I do, little girl; I love it more than anything.
And what is the matter with you?
We came to this most painful resolve knowing well that it would cast a blight upon your life, that wherever you went the knowledge that you had been publicly expelled from the Great Shirley School would follow you--that you would, in short, step down, Ruth Craven.
I should like David to help me.
It was a pleasant morning: the windows were open; the schoolrooms were all well ventilated; the teachers, the best of their kind, were stimulating in their lectures and in their conversation.
"That is as people think, Ruthie; but we weren't in the position, and never expect to be, of those who are high up in the world." "I am glad you told me about my father and mother," said the girl.
Unless some one has been mean enough to act in that way, there is nothing in the world to prevent my going to school, and taking my accustomed place, and disporting myself in my usual manner.
We'd have quite a party of our own in the school if she took us up.
I love the beauty of the old.
That horrid, prim Cassandra chose to correct me when I came into school, and she has taken my darling away--the only one I love in the whole of England.
The kiss went right down into Miss Spicer's somewhat frozen heart.
But I have no time to talk now; only meet me, and bring as many of the foundationers as you can collect into the left-hand corner of the playground, just behind the Botanical Laboratory, at recess." Kate made no answer, unless a toss of her head could have been taken as a reply.
I suppose I must ask Alice to come with me." "Whom is your telegram from, dear?" asked Mrs.
A tall lady with jet-black hair combed back from a massive forehead, and beautifully dressed in long, clinging garments of deep purple, stood on the hearth.
You are not the sort of child who could stand disgrace." "And you don't look the sort of child who would under ordinary circumstances act the idiot," said Miss Mackenzie sharply.
You mustn't say no; I will give you some if you are nice.
"Stroke my hair, granddad," she said.
"Come, girls," said their queen--"come; there is room on the platform." She sprang up the couple of steps without another word, and the girls followed her.
"What wouldn't every other girl in the school give to have such a face as that, and such hair as that?" thought Cassandra.
The work went on, and to look at those girls, all steadfast and attentive and studious-looking, it was difficult to realize that in some of their hearts was wild rebellion and a naughty and ever-increasing sense of mischief.
He had finished his breakfast when Ruth, in her neat Sunday dress, entered the room.
She removed the blouse, folded it in tissue-paper, put it into her drawer, blew out the candles, and got into bed.
How silly you are!" "Is it silly?
I can't help telling you so, my child." "In my opinion, it is hardly earned," said Alice.
Susy glanced at her mother, and could not help reflecting that the poor woman was fit to drop.
Ruth lived in a cottage which was little better than a workman's cottage.
For do that thing I will, and as quickly as possible." Kathleen thought rapidly.
I have a magnifying-glass, too, that I can put into the microscope; it will make you see the root of a hair on your head.
I, of course, will be your head; as you have made me queen, that is the natural thing to expect." "Of course," said Susy.
"However, I'm guessing they are going to make a fuss about it in the school." "And what will you do then, core of my heart?" "Stick to them, of course, aunty.
And isn't this water-cress nice?
Susy, as a member of the Cabinet, must certainly be one of the last to break the rules.
This society must be broken up immediately.
Perhaps you are not the greatest queen, but still you are a queen, and you could lead the whole school." "That would be rather fun," said Kathleen.
There was a great tree, which cast a huge shadow, just before the winding passage was reached.
Give me a tray and I will fill it up and take the things upstairs with my own hands.
I think Kathleen will be all right when we really get to know her; but she is very undisciplined.
"What are you staring at me for?" said Ben.
You will have defied their authority, and that is what they cannot permit.
Her jacket was bright blue, and she had a skirt to match.
You don't know the Great Shirley School as well as I do.
"I never did see a more thoughtful young lady." "My dear child," said Mrs.
"You must not say unkind things." "Don't trouble to reprove her, David," called out Alice in a calm and lofty tone.
And she has taken a dislike, as far as I can see, to Alice Tennant." "And I'm sure I'm not surprised," said Rosy Myers.
I want to help those who are down-trodden and distressed.
"She is in the hall, miss." Kathleen flew out, and before Mrs.
There was a narrow path, bordered on each side with a box-hedge, down which the girls walked.
She bade Susy good-bye and walked on; her attitude was that of one who was thinking hard.
"All right," she said, "I will go; but I won't go yet.
These latter were looked down upon by the least noble and the meanest of their fellow-scholars.
I can't quite get over it.
She was stepping along leisurely, looking up sometimes at the sky, and sometimes pausing as though she was thinking hard.
Her face was full of intelligence, but was rather plain than otherwise, for her mouth was too wide and her nose the reverse of classical.
There is a loft over one, and I keep apples and nuts there.
On Christmas Day they come to the castle and have dinner as well as tea.
I believe I shall always be a rebel.
The mischievous, dare-devil expression of her face when awake was softened in her sleep.
All justice has been dealt out to you, and all patience.
You can sit up a little longer to-night to finish your lessons if you are much interrupted while I am away." "You are sure you will not be more than an hour, mother?" "Oh, certain." "And I suppose in any case I may shut up the shop at seven o'clock, mayn't I?" "Shut the shop at seven o'clock!" said Mrs.
I'm persuaded that it's nothing but a cold.
Kate was big, black-eyed, impudent.
"What can be the matter?" she thought.
Your grandparents were both in trade; there's no way out of it." "But a gentleman and lady for all that," said the girl.
The girls crowded round to admire, and "Oh, my!" "Oh, dear!" "Did you ever?" and "Well, I never!" sounded on all sides.
"Oh, do say what you are laughing about!" said another girl, running up to the group at this moment.
"Grandfather agrees with me," she said to herself.
Children like the foundationers, who are received at the school without being expected to pay anything, who get the most admirable education free of all cost, daring to set up their opinion against girls who, without being in any sense their superiors--one doesn't want to imply that for an instant--are yet vastly superior in numbers.
I like potatoes better than anything in the world.
She wants to join our alms-women." "What?" "You know what a snug time our dear old alms-women have.
"I knew you were quixotic.
"She really is a great trial," thought Alice.
She hadn't a thing handy in the place.
I shall see Kathleen O'Hara, but from what you say, and from what I have heard, I am greatly shocked to have to say it, but I think it possible that she may not be induced to tell the exact truth.
It was worth coming to school now to be in the vicinity of one so handsome and so gay.
You can't think what impudent sort of boys my brothers are, and they have always twitted me for my good fortune in getting into the Great Shirley School.
I won't betray Kathleen O'Hara." CHAPTER XXIII.
He had a large account-book open in front of him, and when Ruth entered he laid down the pen with which he had been summing up his figures.
"This is fun," she said.
"It's too late now," she said; "the girls have come and gone.
You must allow me to stand alone; I am your queen." "That you are, and I love you," said Mary.
Two or three people arrived during Maria's absence, and Kathleen went promptly to the door and said, "Not at home, ma'am," in a determined voice, and with rather a scowling face, to these arrivals.
I hope when you get strong again you will come over and stay with father and mother and me at Carrigrohane Castle." "No, no, my love.
He took them into the yard outside the station, and called a four-wheeler.
She thrust the letter into her pocket and proceeded with her work.
But then, they needn't be.
You can go home to your mother and tell her I am very much annoyed indeed." "But, Aunt Church," said Tom, "if you were to see poor mother you wouldn't blame her.
"I assure you the paying girls think no end of themselves.
"The thing about these badges is that you will always feel them pressing against your hearts, and nobody else will know anything about them.
Poor Hopkins had to pay the money, and from that moment the affairs in the stationer's shop were the reverse of flourishing.
My word!--Tom, my boy, pass me a fork to examine." Tom took up a fork and handed it to Mrs.
That would be the final straw.
But it's the first of the month, and she was never behindhand--I will say that--in her payments before." "She's fretting past bearing," said Tom.
Don't you know how I love you?
I'll teach you how to shoot rabbits and to bring down a bird on the wing." She brushed her lips against his cheek, and ran lightly upstairs.
He was weather-beaten and slipshod, and altogether made a most disreputable appearance.
Tennant and the boys, and then with Alice started off to school with her satchel of books slung over her shoulder, her gay, pretty dress making her look a most remarkable figure amongst all the girls who were going towards the great school, and her saucy bright face attracting attention on all sides.
I shall be in the train and far enough away before they have discovered that I have gone," was her thought.
"Ruth, do have a potato with me," said Kathleen; "they are first-rate when you don't put a knife or fork near them." But Ruth had no inclination for potatoes eaten in the Irish way.
When she stopped, tears were running down her cheeks.
Later on she allowed him to munch some very poor and very stale plumcake.
"If you don't mind, mother, I will go to bed now." Meanwhile things were moving rather rapidly in another direction.
Tennant's face, and her heart relented.
"Your name?" said Miss Mackenzie.
It must have cost you a great deal to feed and clothe me." "No, no, child; far from that.
It is a bag for your knitting.
Think of the help you want to give your grandparents.
All eyes were then turned in her direction; all eyes fixed themselves on the showily dressed and very handsome child who suddenly entered the room.
If, therefore, you do not immediately forsake that society, and immediately promise here and now that you will give it up forever, we shall have the painful duty of expelling you from the school.
"I will hear her out.
"I am all in a puzzle," she said, "to know where to hold the next meeting, for there is no doubt that some of the girls who hate us because they weren't asked to join spied last time; so I want the society to meet the night after next in a new place." "And I'll tell you what I've been thinking," said Aunt Katie; "that I'll be present, and bring a sparkle of old Ireland to help the whole affair.
I mean to write to father and ask him whether I may not invite some of the members of the Cabinet to Carrigrohane.
She entered a week ago.
She said she'd do what she could to put you into one of those sweet little almshouses; and when Miss Kathleen says a thing she means it.
She will either tell publicly what she knows of the Wild Irish Girls or be publicly expelled." "Oh, poor Ruth!" said Cassandra.
Will meet you at a quarter to nine outside Mrs.
I have come here for her.
And may I take you and Miss O'Flynn into the house to see Aunt Church?" Kathleen nodded in reply.
"Ah, Susy, here I am.
Her mother ought to be coming in now.
But the advent of Kathleen on the scene was a great relief, for her father paid three guineas a week for Mrs.
But Ruth's unhappy face certainly attracted attention.
"It is seldom that one has the pleasure of teaching real talent, and I can't say how refreshing it is to me to hear you play as you do.
Where are your manners, Ruth?--Ah, Miss O'Hara, I'm right pleased to see you!
I'm afraid the night is a little bit chilly.--Miss Kathleen, I wish I could get up and offer you a seat, but as it is--" "Oh, nonsense!" said Kathleen.
'Tain't right to keep an old body on tenter-hooks." "I will tell you if you will promise me something.
I am afraid that they know the name of the leader, but they must also get the names of her companions--all the names--and as much as possible of the rules of the society.
You are a perfect plague to me, and that is the truth, Alice Tennant." Alice poured some water into her basin, washed her hands, and went downstairs.
She had a dull, stunned kind of feeling round her heart.
I arrived here as safely as a girl could.
Oh, I could tell them lots of things." "It would be very nice if you came over; and I am almost sure there is a cottage vacant," said Kathleen in a contemplative voice.
"What next will the child ask?
May I play you something different?" Miss Spicer was about to refuse, but looking at the girl, whose cheeks were flushed and eyes full of fire, she changed her mind.
Why, old man, what does a woman want with all that learning?" "If a woman has brains she's bound to use them," replied the old man, as he sat down by the kitchen fire.
"But my grandparents will be expecting me," said Ruth.
Perhaps it is a practical joke of Tom's; you know he is fond of doing things of that sort now and then." "No, it isn't, for I asked him.
She is, in my opinion, extremely silly, and a very naughty child.--Miss Ravenscroft, we leave it to you to bring the little girl to reason.
But Tom was truthful, and he had but a lame story to tell.
When she ran quickly home under the stars she began to realize what she had done She had done something of which her mother would have been ashamed.
these darling little cuffs at the end of the sleeves, and this sweet pink embroidery and this little ruffle of lace round the neck.
"You shall have your almshouse if it can be got.
KATHLEEN TAKES RUTH TO TOWN.
Tennant--who, to tell the truth, found her considerably in the way--Kathleen, accompanied by Alice, started for school.
But all through the remainder of the night Susy dreamt of her blouse.
I am going to be late this morning.
Now, Cassandra, without going into particulars, it is the firm intention, not only of myself as head-mistress, but also of the governors, to crush this matter in the bud.
"And what a neat little bodice my Susy is wearing!" said Mrs.
I am tired out with one thing and another.
When I left the house yesterday there were three pounds in the till--three pounds and fivepence-halfpenny.
"Why should I be afraid?
It will be a wonderful stimulation, and a great interest to me.
She was accustomed to the fact that her mother was always in money difficulties.
honey, then." "I do wish--" Kathleen suddenly sprang upright on her bed.
"Perhaps some one would tell me when the next train for Merrifield leaves Charing Cross," was Ruth's next remark.
Don't talk in that silly way to me.
There were several other mothers as well, and when they saw Kathleen they turned their backs on her, and one or two were heard to say aloud: "It's she who has done it." But Mrs.
And now, will you help or will you not?" "Well, I never!" said Mrs.
Now the spirit of the school is quite against secrecy in any form.
You don't mean to say you demean yourself by associating with tradesmen's daughters?" "I do so, aunty; and I find them very much nicer than the stuck-up girls who think no end of themselves." "Well, well," said Miss O'Flynn, "whatever you are, you are a lady born and bred, and nothing can lower that sort--nothing nor nobody.
I like the shape of your face, and the way you are made, and the wonderful look in your eyes when you glance round at me.
Susy went up to her somewhat unwillingly.
"I have often met your grandfather.
The bolster carefully manipulated had done its work; it had never occurred to Alice that the form in the bed was anything but the living form of Kathleen O'Hara.
We'll be back in no time.
Here's the train; let us hop in at once." "But where are all the others--the forty?" gasped Kathleen.
Oh, Aunt Church, you are in luck!" "You are enough to distract any one, child.
Ruth, of all people!" "It is very queer of her," said Susy, "not to be grateful and pleased, for she is no better than the rest of us." "No better than the rest of you, Susy?" said Kathleen, raising her brows in surprise.
Kathleen saw them from the window; she tapped on the window with her knuckles, nodded to them, kissed her hand, and looked radiant with delight.
But I commanded." "I know, I tried to explain, but she is new to school and--and spoilt." "She must be." Miss Ravenscroft was silent for a minute.
She had also brought sixpennyworth of apples with her.
She stood for a moment in one of the corridors to collect her thoughts; then going to the room where the hats and jackets hung on pegs, she took down her own, put them on, and left the school.
Of course, I can eat anything, but I don't specially like them; so if you don't mind I will have a sausage, too, and a plateful of shrimps afterwards, and some sardines.
"I wonder if you'd help me, Ben." "What can I do?" asked Ben.
You don't look more than twenty.
"Why didn't you send for the police?
Tom arrived at the door with the wheelbarrow about two o'clock.
"Of course she mustn't go into an almshouse if she is rich; but she doesn't look rich." "She is quite rich.
When Ruth found herself alone she paused and looked behind her.
Where did you get it?" "I don't think it is any business of yours, Aunt Church." "Susy!" said her mother in a voice of terror.
Now, there were certain rules in the school which all the girls were expected to keep, and winking and making faces were always prohibited.
Their eyes often met, and those eyes spoke volumes.
Kathleen's intensely rosy cheeks--for the fire had considerably scorched them--attracted Alice's attention.
"And what you do mean by a glorious time?
And what would mother say?
"We all think, dear," continued Mrs.
It would be a great pleasure to me." "You are very kind.
Cassandra was so anxious to see her, so determined to use her influence on what she considered the scale of right, that she was waiting for Ruth at the little gate.
The school has got into trouble, and the governors and Miss Ravenscroft mean to sift the matter to the very bottom.
Meanwhile Ruth went slowly to school.
Oh, to know freedom and then to be torn away from it!
"Isn't she all that I have said?" "Yes, and more.
Answer me: did you?" "I can't answer you, Miss O'Hara.
Maria is keeping company, she tells me, and would like a few fine clothes--naturally, the creature!
But you have seen such a lot of life, haven't you?" "Miss, I can't express all the tales I could tell.
She had also some mathematical work to get through or she would never be able to keep her place in class.
He was touching his mouth, which he opened into a round O, pointing at the cake and honey, and going on altogether in a way that distracted poor Susy.
That is my position, and I hope as long as I live to do my duty.
I can't tell you how I think about it, and love to feel that my own little lass is doing so well there.
"I have heaps and lashons of faults; but I do like to make people happy.
"What has that horrid girl done to you?" "Nothing--nothing." "But she has." "Please, Cassie, she is not horrid." "Oh, well, we won't discuss her.
"Coming, wife--coming presently," he said.
We don't want them to be extravagant; but they always come up to the castle in velveteen dresses, with white caps, and white collars round their necks; and they look very nice.
When the meal, which was but a short one after all, came to an end, Miss O'Flynn and Kathleen got up and were preparing to go to the yard at the back of the house, when there came the sound of horse's hoofs on the stones outside.
That sort of very rich popular girl always makes mischief.
So you will have to go to her to-night and tell her that she must meet me on my way to school to-morrow.
I am very remarkable, and I am very naughty.
"But you will think it over, Ruth.
Tell you, Susy, I'm up to a lark, and the best of the supper goes down my throat.
Say, 'it is mine, and I mean to wear it.' Oh, I'd manage Alice if I happened to be her mother." "I don't think you would, dear." "Indeed, but I would.
We girls are not allowed to go to London by ourselves." "As if that mattered." "It matters to me, if it does not to you.
Kathleen, it is sometimes a hard thing to give up your own way, but I think an Irish girl can be noble.
Ben and Kathleen were now alone.
Is your grandmother ill?" "No; she's quite well." "And your grandfather?" "They are both quite well.
They say that if we are to be expelled it will be done in public.
Church was determined to spend no money, if possible, until Mrs.
I can play on the piano to imitate any birds that ever sung at home, and father loves that.
Your hair is jet-black, Ruthie--almost blue-black.
"You may suppose you are a favorite with Aunt Church, but you are nothing at all to me; I can just twist her round my fingers.
Kathleen won't let me in; she really is intolerable.
How dare she order me about?
Alice Tennant was also in her class, and she looked very bold and upright and defiant.
Craven more often than not had his little cask of beer empty.
Can you send me a ten-pound note, daddy mine, and say nothing whatever about it to the mother or the retainers at Carrigrohane?
Do you know that once we walked across a little bridge of metal which is put between two of the stables?
It is her room as much as yours.
But it was not Mrs.
Naylor, will you now say what you think to Ruth Craven?" "I think, dear child," said Mrs.
But never mind; I won't tell him.
"Did you ever see anything like it?" said Alice to her mother.
She fixed her eyes now on Susy in a very meaning way.
"And you can take me there?" "This blessed minute." "All right; come along." "When will you give me the diamond set in the brooch?" "It isn't a real diamond, you know.
Shall I make it?" "The tea is in that little brown caddy," said Mrs.
I wish I was back in the old country.
They received their badges with hands that very nearly trembled.
If you only knew the snubbing she gave me yesterday.
It was, as Tom expressed it, a perfect day.
You will excuse me; I can't.
She certainly--although she said she would not--did cobble these stockings to an extraordinary extent; but her work and the chat with Mrs.
May I sit down a minute while your servant fetches her?
Nevertheless, grandfather, speaking to me from your own heart, ought the girl to betray her companions?" "Upon my word!" said the old man, who was intensely moved by Ruth's story.
That evening at about a quarter to eight a band of perfectly silent girls might have been seen walking along the road that led to Mrs.
"Mother," she said, rushing into her mother's presence, "we shall have no end of trouble with that terrible girl.
Perhaps they had an eye to the reversion of the tea, the sausages, the sardines, the shrimps, and the water-cress.
I am not a bit a stingy sort of girl; you know that, Alice.
No one came into the shop; certainly no one stole the money." "My dear child, seeing is believing.
"Miss O'Hara," she said, "can I speak to you for a moment?
"I have sent for you, Cassandra, neither to reprove nor to give you ordinary counsel.
"You are going to stay with me to-night.
She turned and looked with dignity first at Kathleen and then at Cassandra.
Think of your own future." "I think of them all," said Ruth; "but I also think of what father would have said if he were alive.
She came up close to the old man and said: "Do you know, you have a look of my own old grandfather.
Didn't your little heart funk it altogether?" continued Kate.
Susy's thoughts, however, were occupied with very different matters.
She told me about you and your position with the governors." "Oh, need we talk of that?" said Ruth coloring, stopping in her walk, and turning to face Cassandra.
I can't quite hear you." "I am sorry," said Ruth then, "but I can't tell you." Miss Mackenzie, without any show of emotion, immediately entered Ruth's answer in a little book which she held in her hand.
The Wild Irish Girl's Society Is Started 112 XI.
"I don't mind how badly you think of me.
Naylor, speaking in a tremulous voice, which could scarcely be heard half-way down the room, "that it would be best for you not to conceal the truth." "And I agree," said Mrs.
Would you like that best, or would you rather have a profession and be made a gentleman?' "'The gentleman part doesn't matter,' said our boy in reply to that; 'but I think, father, if you can give me my choice, I'd like best to be that which, if necessary, would oblige me to give my life,' "'What do you mean?' asked his father, and the lad explained with his eyes shining.
I am about the happiest girl on earth.
Afterwards we can have a good chat; and then you shall have a room to yourself in order to work up your lessons for Miss Renshaw.
Some time, if you have a headache and feel very bad, as my dear father does sometimes, I shall play to you; but I can't learn as the other girls learn--it isn't in me." Again she put her fingers on the keys of the piano and brought forth a few sobbing, broken-hearted notes.
I never saw anybody quite so horrible as Aunt Church is to-day." "Never mind, Susy; never mind," said her mother.
Be sure you all come.
Susy was looking intensely agitated: there were vivid spots of color on her cheeks, and her eyes were as bright as stars.
I must make the best of it to Miss Ravenscroft, only I am sure she will be very angry with Kathleen." Alice flew to the school.
Tennant, Myrtle Lodge." "Golloptious!" cried Kathleen.
Miss Ravenscroft," said Miss Smyth.
And so you live in a castle, my bonny young lady?" "Yes; my father owns Carrigrohane Castle." "Eh, love!
May I sit here until she comes?" "Of course, my dear," said Mrs.
A good many of them have dresses like you; and they live in little cottages, and we bring them up to the castle and give them good food very, very often.
Thus she had secured herself against intrusion.
And I can love, love, love!
Now then, I'm off." Kathleen ran up to her room, and again she locked the door.
I like you very much, and I want to be kind to everybody; but to compare you or Mary Rand or Rosy Myers, or any of the others, with Ruth Craven--" "But she is no better." "She is a great deal better.
I must finish my own private affairs in my own half of the room." She retreated from the door, and the scratching of the pen continued.
You will have to wear it." "But what will Alice say?" "Never mind.
Kathleen did not reply at all for a moment; then she said in a sleepy, smothered sort of voice which seemed to proceed from the bed: "I have a splitting headache; don't disturb me." "Very sorry," answered Alice, "but I really must come in." Kathleen made no answer.
It was a little better than a workman's house, but not much; there were two rooms downstairs and two rooms upstairs, and that was all.
"I have been standing here for half-an-hour, all drenched with perspiration.
I want to have a word with her." Kathleen pushed past Ruth and ran up to Susy.
"Would you rather I got you your dinner," she said, "or would you rather I talked to you for a little?" "I'd a sight rather my little Ruth sat near me and let me place my hand on her hair.
"Now, there is one girl in the school who could tell us--a charming girl, a new girl--for she also only joined this term--but in all respects the opposite of Kathleen O'Hara.
"You scold when there's no occasion to, and you withhold scolding when it's due.
In fact, the blow killed the poor man.
She had a suggestion to make to Ruth.
Do you like England, my dear?
She looked to right and left of her as though she were slightly alarmed.
She was soon smiling and flushing.
"I am glad you have said what you did about father.
She spoke in a whisper.
Alice was still there, looking more stormy than ever.
It is just a narrow iron rod, six feet in length.
Naylor, I should be much obliged if you would allow Miss Ravenscroft to continue," said Miss Mackenzie.
We earnestly beg of you, therefore; not to make a martyr of yourself in a silly and ridiculous cause.--Mrs.
So it is this way: we have got into trouble, we Wild Irish Girls, and dear Miss Kathleen is determined that, come what will, the society must not suffer; and she thinks you could help.
Oh, you'll enjoy it fine!
"Why, we'd get so weak that mother couldn't earn the money she sends you every month." "And you couldn't do your lessons and be the fine big boy that I am proud of," said Mrs.
I haven't the slightest idea how I am to get there, but I will go to Aunt Katie O'Flynn.
I'll manage without it somehow.
She never thought of buying any new clothes, and her black bombazine dress was more brown than black now; so was her shawl, and so was the handkerchief which she wore round her neck.
Poor dear mother doesn't know what she is talking about." Occupied with her own thoughts, the road did not turn out long to Susy.
When she had uttered these words she sank back in her chair.
We will be as naughty as we like, and we will let the others see what we are made of.
Whatever her father might say, she could not desert the girls who belonged to her society now.
Miss Mackenzie glanced at the other ladies.
James the Less, the church just around the corner; you know it?" "Yes, I know it," said Susy.
But how could I--how could I withstand her?" Supper at the Tennants' generally consisted of cold pudding, cold meat, bread-and-butter, and a little jam when there happened to be any in the house.
"It is my secret," she said.
I am determined to take up Latin; I want to get to the heart of things." "Quite right--quite right, too.
"I didn't know that I was so comical," was his answer.
Perhaps I'll settle down to work.
"I wonder--" she said slowly.
She turned away from Alice.
You won't refuse me, will you, Ruth?" "But I don't know what you want," said Ruth.
I am sent for in a hurry to my sister's; she has a bad cold, and wants me to call in.
"Cassandra, I will write to you.
Kathleen's cheeks got redder and redder.
That look seemed suddenly to steady her nerves.
I know I am a foundationer and my education is free; but there are other small expenses that have to be met.
You haven't touched any," said Mrs.
"Yes," said Alice, "that is just like her--just the sort of thing she would do.
But perhaps when you see Miss O'Hara and Miss O'Flynn you'll take a fit of shyness.
"I tell, you what it is, Susy, I won't be able to buy you a new winter frock at all this year; and you will have to have your boots patched, for I can't afford a new pair.
If in the future she could not play in public, she resolved at least to earn her living as a music teacher.
She had not been at all willing to lend Mrs.
If you only would come and make use of it.
2 Willow Cottages." "Oh, I know," said Miss Mackenzie, looking with more approval at the child.
It came over me all of a sudden how lazy I was, and how wrong to neglect the shop and not give your grandmother a bit of help with the customers; and so strong was the notion over me that I unlocked the old bureau and took out the account-books.
A slight look of relief was visible on the faces of the unfortunate girls who had gone to town with Kathleen on the preceding night.
"Ah!" said Kathleen, looking with great appreciation around her--"ah!
Don't keep me, please; it is very important." "But I don't know who Ruth Craven is." "Oh, mother, I thought every one knew her.
"Whatever happens," she added, "he must never know." "What do you mean about whatever happens?" "He must never know if I do not get it.
But if the balance didn't come out on the right side she'd stay at home.
Oh, Ruth, mayn't we stand up in the hansom?
If all Irish girls are like her, Ireland must be a wonderful country to live in." "But they are not," said Ruth.
Tom enjoyed his visits to Mrs.
She is a wonderful girl--so graceful, and with such a power of eloquence.
You will get to like it very much after a time.
I can play all the dead-marches to make mother cry, and I can play--oh, such dance music for Aunt Katie O'Flynn!
She gave a quick glance round her, then came up to Mrs.
"That is nice," she said, and caught his hand as it went backwards and forwards over her silky black hair, and kissed it.
It was intolerable that she should put on such airs.
Church glanced from one to the other.
She curtsied before her little glass.
Church; "but if you are certain sure she will keep her word--" "If I am sure of anybody, it is Miss Kathleen." "She looks a good sort." "And then, you know, Aunty Church, you can clinch matters by having a nice little tea for her; and afterwards, if you don't speak up, I will.
Only I made no fortune by grocery--barely enough to put my boy into the army and to educate him for it, and enough to keep us with a pittance now that we are old.
"God help me," she said under her breath.--"Cassie, if you knew, if you could guess, you'd pity me." Ruth turned away and followed the teacher into the school.
The governors and the mistress ought not to allow such a girl in the school.
You ask me to make you a promise.
If there were forty girls, their tickets would cost a good deal.
This turned out to be the case.
Hopkins was busy in the kitchen.
"Ruth--Ruth!" said a somewhat querulous but very deep voice which evidently issued from the parlor.
Wake up, won't you, Alice?" she said.
To her relief, she saw that they were alone.
These brothers were schoolboys of the unruly type.
You know you said that you were always losing the ball; it would keep running under your chair, and you could never get it without stooping and hurting yourself." "To be sure I did, child, and it is thoughtful of you to think of me.
It was now getting dusk.
But Alice--she is--" "What, darling?" "A prig, aunty.
They meet, I have discovered, at night; their rendezvous being, up to the present, a certain quarry a short distance out of town.
I had her examined, and found that she knew extremely little.
I think potatoes are better than anything in the world." "Well, miss, if you'd like a potato it's at your service." "I should if it is in its jacket." "What did you say, miss?" "If the potato is boiled in its jacket.
"I thought when you sent Susy to me with your message that I might as well come here this morning; but I haven't changed my mind--not a bit of it." Kathleen's eyes, always extraordinarily dark for blue eyes, now grew almost black.
Afterwards, when she came out again, her poor mother had died, and her grandmother likewise; and her brother, who was the moral image of Tom there, wouldn't receive her in his house.
"Sit down on that chair.
Hopkins, assisted by Susy, had removed the cloth, and the little maid had swept up the hearth, Mrs.
"I can't even imagine who the other ladies can be," she said.
I have always nearly died to have one; but of course I couldn't do that, for it would displease our queen, the darling, and I wouldn't for all I am worth do anything to annoy her.
There was a faint applause which came from different parts of the room, but was not unanimous, and soon died away.
My grandparents can scarcely afford the expense of keeping me in this school.
Susy ran up to her room, tossed off her hat, washed her hands, and came down.
I have to send this letter to my son in India, and I'd miss the mail if it wasn't posted to-night.
Thank you so much, Miss Tennant!" "Don't thank me," said Alice, frowning; "and don't say 'Miss Tennant,' It isn't good form in our school.
But I am more glad to think that there never was such an honorable man as you, granddad, and that you made the grocery trade one of the best in the world." "It was a bad trade, my darling.
"But perhaps it is best.
Susy walked into the school with her head high in the air; she quite adored Kathleen, for she was making her a person of great distinction.
We used to sit in Phoenix Park.
Susy went into the parlor, where tea was laid on the table.
And give me a gun and see me bring down a bird on the wing.
It would be rare fun to have her there." "But she is not a bit poor.
You can therefore imagine the great and wonderful delight of being able to secure a scholarship of sixty pounds a year.
Then aloud: "What is it you want?
"Ruth," she said, "go and talk to Susy Hopkins during recess.
There wasn't any contract but that I could demand it whenever I wanted it, and it is about convenient to me that I should have it back now.
Well, I can't help myself, only I won't hate the girls who are good to me.
I wish you could see it from Carrigrohane.
I tell you what it is: I think I shall take to you." "Oh, would you, indeed, miss?" said Susy, her eyes sparkling.
"I was in such a taking," said the woman.
Make the best of it, darling.
What can it be about?" said Alice.
It seems scarcely fair that I should be the one to run her to earth." "The fairness or the unfairness of the question is not now to be discussed," said Miss Ravenscroft.
She got quite dreadful about the blouse, and she tried to make out that I had stolen the money from mother to buy it.
It was in that light Miss O'Flynn chose to consider her conduct.
She was just drawing a pair of gloves on her hands when Alice was heard turning the handle of the door.
Kathleen's first step, therefore, towards the formation of a secret society in the Great Shirley School was marked with success.
Think, Aunt Church; it is quite worth while when you have an almshouse in view; and you know that for all the rest of your life you are to have a house rent-free, coal and light, and six shillings a week." "It's worth an effort," said Mrs.
What a good thing she didn't meet Mrs.
"I wish I could help you, mother.
What?" said the old lady.
I promised Kathleen most faithfully that I would deliver her message.
"Dear, dear!" she said, and she sat down in the easy-chair which Mrs.
The hall was quite dark.
Hot sausages?--They are done to a turn, aren't they, Maria?" "That they are, miss." "A nice hot sausage on toast, and a lovely cup of tea with cream in it." "But--but," said Mrs.
Over all she slipped her dark-blue velvet jacket, and with rich sables round her neck and wrists, she ran downstairs.
Tears rose to her eyes; she took out her handkerchief to wipe them away.
Susy, what does this mean?" "I am sure, mother, I can't tell you.
You did not leave the parlor, did you?" For one minute Susy remembered that she had gone upstairs for an exercise-book, but she determined not to tell her mother of this further enormity.
"What is it you want?" "I want you to open the door, Kathleen.
Then, too, think of the blouses we have got.
You can't imagine what I am feeling.
She had been working in various ways ever since six o'clock that morning, and the darning of the boys' rough socks hurt her eyes and made her fingers ache.
"Now, Ruth," said that lady, "I have given you as long a time as possible.
She is very unhappy about something.
As the woman was wrapping them up in a piece of torn newspaper, she looked at Ruth and said: "Is it true, Miss Craven, that you are a scholar at the Great Shirley School?" "I am," replied Ruth.
She shut her eyes, folded her arms, and prepared for further slumber; but somehow Kathleen had effectually aroused her.
Her father and I were sitting by the hearth, and the boy came and stood near us.
No one ever thinks about her as she ought to be thought of; so I have some plans in my head for her, too.
Her name is Cassandra Weldon." "Of course I know Cassandra Weldon," said the head-mistress.
You can't think how excited we are." "Oh, I'm willing to be quick," replied Kathleen.
Afterwards, when Ruth had returned to her own home, Cassandra sat with her head in her hands for the best part of an hour.
"Upon my word," she said, "I'm not at all sorry I came.
I must go to her at once.
"What a dull hole this is!
I am sure I should love you very much if I knew you well." "That is not the question, my dear.
The ugliness of it would make you sick.
Go round to-day and see as many as you can.
Tennant, Alice, and two young brothers.
The Great Shirley School met at nine.
Alice's quiet breathing sounded not many feet away, and after a time it seemed to get on Kathleen's nerves.
I know Kathleen isn't popular with the mistresses." "That puzzles me," said Mrs.
Don't you know what an affinity means?
She was a tall, strong-minded woman, with iron-gray hair, false teeth, a prominent nose, and small steel-gray eyes.
It did not occur to her as possible that what she and her companions had done could be known.
I have a rosy apple which shall find its way into your pocket if you take me home in double-quick time." Tom pulled with a will; the little bath-chair creaked and groaned, and Mrs.
Provided Alice's side was left in peace, she determined to shut her eyes to untidy wardrobes, to the chest of drawers full to bursting, to a boot kicked off here and a shoe disporting itself there, to ribbons and laces and handkerchiefs and scarves and blouses scattered on the bed, and even on the floor.
It's lost I'd be in a place of this sort.
I got it honestly, and I am not obliged to tell; and what's more, I won't tell." Mrs.
There was an exalted feeling in her heart, caused by the narrative which her grandmother had told her of her father.
To the front of the little house was the tiny parlour, at the back an equally tiny kitchen.
Why, Susy, you must be a genius, and I thought you weren't much of a sort." "I am better than you think; and she is fond of me." "And you really and truly call her by her Christian name?" "Of course I do." Susy longed to tell Tom about the wonderful society; but its strictest rule was that it was never to be spoken about to outsiders.
Now then, give me your hand.
"They don't wear old bombazine like this, do they?" "Your dress suits you very well, indeed," said Kathleen; "but my old ladies wear velveteen dresses.
James the Less was by no means remarkable for beauty of architecture or adornment of any sort; nevertheless the vicar was a man of great eloquence and earnestness, and in the evenings it was the custom for the little church to be packed.
She had made up her mind that she would wear her new blouse at dinner that day.
Tennant could not help laughing as Kathleen described the sort of girl she would be if she adopted Alice's role.
He said I looked very genteel, and that he'd like his great friend, Walter Amber, to see me.
You girls of the present day are so queer, there's no being up to half your pranks.
I'll be in the hall.
"Afterwards--afterwards--But I must hear the whole thing out." Miss Mackenzie turned, and in a very emphatic voice began to question.
Kathleen had shut the window behind her before she trusted herself to the ivy; she had also unlocked the door.
There will be about eight of us waiting for you in the old quarry.
Her lessons, too, were by no means distasteful.
I trust, however, my dear child, that such extreme measures will not be necessary.
Kathleen smiled as she handed one to Mary Rand, another to Ruth Craven, another to Kate Rourke, and finally to each member of her Cabinet.
I have been trying to induce her to stay here herself, but she won't; and as Ruth is anxious to return home, her escort has come very opportunely.
Maria went out, and Kathleen stood in the hall.
Stay, I will tempt her.--Kathleen!" "Yes, darling." "Wouldn't you like to come with me to Cassandra Weldon's?
She was asked certain questions, which she absolutely refused to answer.
Don't you think it is very nice of me to think of my friends?
Aunt Katie flung herself into a deep arm-chair; Kathleen did likewise, and then they talked to their heart's content.
I could tell you, you know, that you have quite a fascinating smile, and a very taking voice, and a delightful and polished manner; but I prefer to tell you that you are comical, which means that I feel inclined to burst out laughing whenever I look at you." "Thank you," said Ben, who could be very sulky when he liked.
I have told him so much about you, and I have told granny too, and they both picture you somewhat as you are.
The door was opened for her by old Mrs.
Presently three foundation girls entered the gates side by side and glanced up at her.
The two young ladies are out in the garden." "Thank you," said Kathleen.
I do want to do just what is right." Thus, lagging as she walked, she by slow degrees reached her home.
"No, no; one of those two-wheeled things," said the little girl.
I never did see a more elegant figure.
She'll fig you all out, every one of you, if you like--you and Alice and David and Ben and cook and Maria.
Kathleen returned quite safely to Myrtle Lodge.
She began to ladle out spoonful after spoonful and put it into the little brown teapot, which she then filled up with hot water.
Weldon's supper party was to begin at eight o'clock.
If they were men and she was a man, Janey Ford had whispered to her great friend Edith Hart, they would follow her to the death.
I allude to Ruth Craven." "Poor little Ruth!" said Cassandra.
I had one last night." "No, you had not." "Alice, dear, why do you speak to Kathleen like that?" said her mother.
"You are a Great Shirley girl yourself," she said.
Tom finally promised to secure her photograph by hook or by crook, and to show it to them.
Church's supper except a bit of stale cake, a hunch of brown bread, and a little tea.
"We'll meet to-night, sha'n't we?" "I don't know," said Ruth.
On her neck she wore a rich necklet of flaming beads, which was extremely becoming to her; and thrown carelessly round her neck and shoulders was a boa of white fur, and she had a muff to match.
I scarcely took a penny this morning, and that nineteen-and-sixpence makes it impossible for me to pay my rent, as I meant to do, to-day.
"Have you any luggage in the van, miss?" was the immediate inquiry.
I do not ask the girls who are spoken of as the paying girls to expose their companions, nor do I ask those foundationers who have not joined the band of insurgents to betray their fellows; but what I do ask is this: that the girls themselves--the rebels--should rise in a body and point to their leader.
I could never lift up my head again.
"You look very pale, dear Ruth," she said.
It was just at that moment that Ruth in her shabby dress, but with her sweet and most beautiful face, joined the group of girls who were going into the school.
Don't let her hear you giggling, please, Kate; it is very unkind to make a new girl feel uncomfortable." Kate smothered a laugh and turned away.
"Now don't be angry, for you don't know how to manage it.
Take it off and put it on the hob; and be careful, for goodness' sake, Susy Hopkins, or you'll scald yourself." Susy removed the kettle from its position on the glowing bed of coals, and then resumed her narrative.
Tennant, "for I never met a more charming girl." "I know you think so; but, you see, mere charm of manner doesn't go down in a great school like ours.
"I left my satchel and came back for it," she said as she vanished from their view.
What is the matter?" "I--I can't." "You can.
Then the tea was unpacked.
Here is a shilling; go to the shop and bring in some sausages.
It is about half a mile away, just at the back of Colliers' Buildings.
Susy stretched out her hand and clutched that of a slim girl who was following in the train of people.
It will be doomsday before we can get you another like it.
It is awfully lonely for a girl like me, who has got dozens of cousins at home, and uncles and aunts and all the rest of the goodly fry, to be stranded.
"Now, such a girl oughtn't to be on the foundation at all.
Oh, what didn't we do?
What have you got for the old lady's tea, mother?" "Well, now, look here.
If she could do anything well, she could run in a race.
"It wants to crush us," continued Kathleen.
"My word," said Tom, "I must be in it!" "But you can't, Tom.
"She'd give all the world to be able to pay you up, but she ain't got the money, and that's a fact.
"You and I will have some fun, perhaps, this afternoon," she said.
"Don't tire your dear voice," she said.
Oh, she is just right in every way, and yet I feel that I hate her.
"Ah, deary!" he said, "I have been missing you all day.
I hope I have some proper pride." "Pride of the _most_ proper sort," said Kathleen, dancing before her.
My old nurse had it made for me, and I wear it sometimes.
"Why have you shut the shop?" said Mrs.
Well, Susan, you may take my little story for what it is worth, and much good may it do you." "I think you are very rude indeed, Aunt Church," said Susy.
Susy and Tom, you are both good children.
It isn't our way; and I don't think--you will forgive me for saying it--that your way is as nice as ours.
Now what will you do?" "What shall I do?" said Mrs.
No, I don't mean to learn _music_ at the Great Shirley School; I can't.
"Any one could tell she is just trying it on.
But it is essential that the name of the ringleader, as well as her rules and her motives, should be declared." Miss Ravenscroft paused again and looked down the whole length of the long hall.
He showed her the right booking-office, and she secured two first-class single tickets for herself and Ruth.
Kathleen is the dearest, truest, greatest lady I ever came across.
"It is because I will not be a traitor," she added, lowering her voice, then flinging up her head and gazing proudly before her.
"Well; she doesn't like her either, though she doesn't use that kind of language," continued Susy.
Ruth, is it true that they want you to tell?" "They want me to, Kathleen," said Ruth; "but I am not going to.
You have a few minutes in which to decide.
The remains of a rough-looking tea were on the table.
Kathleen had on a very shabby coat, a most unsuitable cap of bright-blue velvet on her clustering masses of curls, and no necktie and no gloves.
"Then, if you please," continued Kathleen, "can you tell me where that sweetly pretty girl, Ruth Craven, lives?" "She isn't a lady," said the girl, whose name was Susan Hopkins.
Ruth's head was bent over her books.
She is here, isn't she?" The man said he would inquire, and went to the bureau.
You have been given time--abundant time--to consider.
Cassandra and her mother, therefore, were from the very first surrounded by scholarship; they belonged, so to speak, to the scholastic world.
She was a spirited, daring girl, but she also had a sweet temper.
But it's all right now.
The man was honest, and asked the customary shilling.
How dare they try to make dear little Ruth betray us?
"Oh, you are Tom Hopkins," she said; "you are Susy's brother.
She was glad of that; she was glad that she was not acutely sorry, or acutely glad, or acutely anxious about anything.
Church had occupied and stared into the fire.
"Aunt Church is coming to dine with us.
I am quite smitten with David; and I like you, too.
I must rush home; there are no end of things to be attended to." "All right," said Mary.
Altogether it was a very bizarre and fascinating little figure that appeared that evening at the Weldons' hall door.
"Now, tell me, child, tell me," he said.
"Was she very, very cross?" "Who do you mean?" asked Kathleen, instantly on the defensive.
It will be terribly hard for the girl if she sticks to her resolve, for the governors of the school have presented what they call an ultimatum to her; they have given her from now till Saturday to make up her mind, and if she refuses on Saturday grandfather, she is to be expelled publicly.
She looked now eagerly for Kathleen, who had shunned her from the instant they had entered the school; she stood just by the gate waiting for her.
What can you mean?" said Mrs.
She left the room and went up to what she called her half of the bedroom on the next floor.
"Well, I am queen." "Certainly you are!" "Who else could be?" "Of course you are queen!" "Darling!" "Dear!" "Sweet!" "Duck!" fell from various pairs of lips.
"I really can't put up with this sort of thing any longer.
"You are welcome to my brothers if you don't toss all your things about in my room," cried Alice.
Oh, wisha, then, if you only could see it!
She was going to be ruined in her old age!
"But you'd have to change a good bit.
I can drop from the window, but I should prefer going by the back door; and I don't think Maria will betray me." Just then Alice strolled into the room.
"Yes and no," said Ruth.
I'll join you after school, and well go straight away.
What class did they put you into?" "I am in the third remove; a very good class indeed--at least they all said so, grandfather." "I don't understand your modern names; but tell me what you have got to learn, dear.
Why, everybody is talking about her.
Hopkins?" "Oh, my dear, not to think of yourself, but of the many who will be ruined--not to tell, Ruth Craven." Ruth gave a gentle smile; then she put out her small slim hand and touched Mrs.
I thought I'd say so, for I mean to do it." "Oh, Kathleen!" said Alice in a distressed voice, "you really mustn't.
Cassandra Weldon noticed it first of all.
"Well, now," she said, speaking with eagerness, her face all smiles and dimples, "the way is made plain for you at least, Miss Craven.--Who do you think has come, Kathleen?
Now there is nothing more to be said." Ruth disentangled herself from Kathleen's embrace, and putting wings to her feet, ran in the direction of the school.
"Of course," said Miss Ravenscroft.
Miss Ravenscroft uttered a deep sigh.
Craven's face--"you know how fond I am of Ruth." "Indeed, my dear young lady, she has been telling me about you; and I am glad you notice her, dear little girl!" "But it is not only I," said Kathleen; "every one in the school likes her.
"I am proud to say that I am." "We don't think anything of the Irish here." "Oh, don't you?" "But don't be angry, please," continued Susy, "for I am sure you are very nice." "I am nice when I like.
Is there likely to be a vacancy soon, Aunt Katie?" "Well, dear, there is a vacancy at the present moment.
I don't think she would willingly do anything to annoy you." "Well, I will see what I can do.
You see, she is in the position of the person who knows everything.
Susan, my dear child, where did you get that beautiful pale-blue blouse?" "I didn't get it through theft, mother, if that's what you are thinking of.
She looked full at Ruth.
We'll be in London before long." "You wouldn't disobey Miss Ravenscroft if you were to be our real queen." "Then I'll not be your queen, darling, for I shall disobey Miss Ravenscroft when it comes to a case of obliging her or dear, darling, precious aunty." Ruth said no more.
If she had spoken in a loud voice Alice would have taken no notice, but there was something pathetic and beautiful in her tone, and Alice raised herself and looked at her.
"Think of the monstrous mischief that is going on in our midst.
I won't worry you at all when you are having your commotion in the yard.
He had no time to count his spoils, but leaving the till-drawer still open, he dashed out of the shop.
The morning was fresh and beautiful; there was a gentle breeze which fanned her face.
"Here I am," said Kathleen; "and here you stand, Ruth.
Please don't ask me." "You look very sad." "I feel miserable." "I wonder--" said Cassandra thoughtfully.
Oh, the fresh air is reviving.
oh!" and she burst into violent sobs.
We could meet you and talk over things." "Well, I will decide to-morrow.
Ruth, having delivered her soul, looked down.
"But I will tell you what, Ruthie.
The rest of her programme was carried out to a nicety.
Why are you going to be so obstinate?
It's only a step away, but you'd better drive if you don't know your London." "We have never been in our London before," said Kathleen in a voice of intense pleasure.
"Let me alone," said Alice.
He was a very knowing boy, and spoke up so well, and was so evidently sorry himself, and so positive that as soon as ever the police were told they would simply lay their hands on the thief and the thief would disgorge his spoils, that Aunt Church was fain to believe him.
There came a rattle at the handle of the door.
Dear Ruth, what can I do for you?" "Give up the society as fast as you can," said Ruth.
"But the lining has got moth-eaten." "Who minds that?" said Tom.
She was impulsive, high-spirited, and defiant, but where her passions were concerned her heart was very soft.
There were a group of foundationers standing round the entrance.
And what a perfect cut about the neck!
She bent towards her husband and whispered in his ear.
Why, Tom, boy, I spend that money on my food, rent, and the little expenses I have to go to.
But, Susy, I want you to do something.
How soon would Alice get tired?
"What is the matter, Ruth?" she repeated.
Kathleen stood just where she had left her; over her face was passing a rapid and curious change.
"I had best not go in, miss," she said.
You are a kindred spirit of mine, Ruth Craven, and you can't get away from me, not even if you will." The fifteen minutes for recreation came to an end, and the girls returned to the schoolroom.
There is no doubt she is very clever, and when she likes she can be extremely agreeable." "She is extremely pretty, you know, and that goes a long way." "Not with me, thank goodness!" said Alice.
The consequence of your mad action has been explained to you with the utmost fullness.
"You can now face me, and your schoolfellows can also see you.--Girls, I have requested Ruth Craven to take the prominent position she now occupies in order that you may all see her.
Church became one of the Irish alms-women, and grumbled a good deal at the change in her position.
They were not even to take any notice of each other until they were off.
One lady was dressed in what I should call a very loud style.
"And a very good little girl Susan Hopkins is," she said, after a moment's pause; "and a particularly great friend of mine, being, so to speak, my grand-niece.--Mary, my dear, call your little girl in." Mrs.
The girls used to ask her to improvise.
It is the ecstacy of shocking the prim Alice!
And you must also acquaint us with the names of the girls who are members." Ruth again was silent, but now she held herself erect and looked full at Miss Mackenzie.
"The principal thing that it means," continued Kathleen, raising her voice to a slightly theatrical pitch, and extending her arm so that the lamplight fell all over it--"the chief thing that it means is to be free--yes, free as the air, free as the mountain streams, free as the dear, darling, glorious, everlasting mountains themselves.
There is one girl who can furnish us will all we want to know, but she dreads, doubtless from conscientious motives, to betray her late companions.
"But what about the girl--the person you are laughing about?" asked Rose.
She wanted him to help her.
There was a restless sound in the room, and then a cross voice said: "Go away." David stopped whistling "Garry Owen," and proceeded to execute a most exquisite performance of "St.
The teacher who had summoned her had gone on in front.
Well, of course not, so I will tell you.
I couldn't do it--not by no means." Mrs.
Aunty--my darling, my own dear, sweet aunt Katie O'Flynn--sent me a telegram to meet her in town.
She'll get tired of sitting there by herself if only you have patience." "But I am due at Cassandra's for supper" and Mary Addersley and Rhoda Pierpont are to call for me at half-past seven." "Oh, that's it, is it?" said David.--"Ben, leave off teasing." For Ben was whistling and jumping about, and making the most expressive faces at poor Alice,--"I will see what I can do," he said, and he ran upstairs.
There were several treasures in it: a necklet of glittering white stones, another of blue, another of red, and this little ring--a little ring which contained a solitary diamond of the purest water.
"Why, Ruth," she said, "you do look pale." "Oh, I am all right," said Ruth, brightening at the sight of Kathleen.
Now the window of Mrs.
And if you get the scholarship, why, we will be made; we won't have another care nor anxiety; we won't have another wrinkle of trouble as long as we remain in the world." Ruth went straight over to the old man, knelt down by his side, and looked into his face.
Miss Ravenscroft was regarding her with kindly eyes.
"Half of them will be in gray and half of them in brown, and a few old dowdies will perhaps be in black.
Ruth Craven in particular had several.
"Is it that she calls it?
Don't you think it is all splendid?" cried Susy.
I cannot give up Cassandra, nor Alice, nor--nor other girls." "Nonsense, Ruth!
I mind the time as well as if it was yesterday.
It is a matter between Kathleen and myself.
"From all you have been telling me, the foundation girls must be particularly clever.
"Ah, my dear good friend, I like to look jolly once in a way.
In recess she went up to her and took her hand.
"I am not nearly as low-spirited as I was," she said after a pause.
Ellen trembled very much in the company of the old lady, and Mrs.
"I'll open the door," said Tom.
After they had passed through they found themselves in a large circular cavern open to the sky.
Had nothing happened to hinder her, she would have been on the platform three minutes before the train came in.
It was nearly three o'clock; tea was to be on the table at half-past four.
She isn't meant to have it.
If I can only get a scholarship I shall be able to help grandfather.
Have you never heard of our society?
You have done something which has distressed her very much.
Oh, my broth of an old dad, wouldn't I like to hug you this blessed minute?
There was something about Kathleen--the bold, bright, and yet generous look on her face, the love which darted out of her eyes when she grasped Ruth's hand--that even impressed Miss Mackenzie.
She has gone to St.
"I am glad I consulted him.
She told me, too, that you have been extremely kind to her.
Maybe there's something in it for you, or maybe there isn't--Mrs.
I can't stay in that horrid room.
Will you forgive me?" "I will, dear, because at the present moment you don't know my girl at all.
"I'd almost like her not to stay with us," thought Susy; "for then perhaps Kathleen would make me her Prime Minister.
The person who can doubtless tell me most is Kathleen O'Hara.
I had a long talk with her.
A handsome old man, with a decided look of Ruth herself, was seated by the fire.
I must go back to granny now.
I'd do anything on earth to please you.
You are afraid of the draughts.
Hopkins was delighted with hers; she thought Tom the noblest boy in the world for having denied himself in order to give it to her.
And I think," added Ruth, "that you ought to come with me.
"I see you are not like others.
She consulted him about her fowls, and gave him a new-laid egg to slip into his pocket for his own supper.
She was without a companion.
"I'd do anything in the world for you, Kathleen.
Now what will you have?
Ruth just glanced at her teacher, and then lowered her eyes.
"I must speak to her." She was just bending forward, meaning to touch Ruth on her shoulder, when there came a commotion near the entrance, and the excited face of Alice Tennant came into view.
They must all congregate in the yard, and you shall look on.
I can't aspire to anything so fine and high up even for your sake, darling, and you are one of the sweetest women on God's earth.
I have something of importance to say to you." "What can she mean?" said Kathleen.
I am very much interested about burglaries.
"Benny," she said then in a most seductive whisper.
"I wish there were others like you in the world." "No, I am not splendid," said Kathleen, her lovely dark eyes looking wistful.
You must come to me every day; Miss Renshaw will be with us each evening from six to seven.
She opened it in some surprise, and read the contents slowly.
Now she was truly a very swift runner, but as she was running to-night, whom should she meet but Mrs.
Can't you give me an attic to myself at the top of the house?" "You know I haven't a corner." "Can't I share your bed, mummy?
Who can have come into the shop?
She knew because she lived with the class who discussed such things very openly.
THE BLOUSE AND THE ROBBERY.
Ross pushed it away from her as though it was beneath notice.
Isn't it a lark?" The little girl felt quite excited.
"Sit down, and let's be cozy.
I was very lonely indeed when I came home from India and left my dear father and mother behind me." "How old were you when you came home?" "A great deal younger than you are: only seven years old.
"I can't give you any further time.
She is far and away the nicest girl in the school.
You don't know the sort of expression it has when it seems to be kissing the sea.
That is the question," said Kathleen in her softest voice.
The lady started back, and could not help contrasting Kathleen's face with those of the other girls.
Weldon looked a little startled.
If you don't tell me in private what you can tell me, I shall be obliged to ask you to appear before the governors.
She is just perfectly splendid.
Church in the act of being deposited in her bath-chair, and Tom, looking proud and flushed, attending on her.
If, therefore, you notice anything--if anything is brought to your ears which I ought to know--you must come to me at once.
Nevertheless Susy was as unhappy as she was happy that day.
So you will stick to me, won't you girls?" "That we will!" came from the mouths of all.
Oh, my broken heart!" She laid her head on David's shoulder and went on sobbing.
I will, however, confide in Cassandra; she is extremely fond of Ruth, and she may influence her where others fail.
The weary morning came to an end at last.
Kathleen drummed with her fingers on her desk and looked round her.
The other girls went in by twos, each clinging to her special crony.
"I am going to have it so.
She is one of my most important friends.
"Isn't it scrumptious?" said Kate Rourke.--"Oh, is that you, Susy Hopkins?
When Susy appeared her mother called out to her: "Come along, you ungrateful girl.
"Kathleen is evidently a very tiresome girl.
It was quite an hour after Alice had departed that Kathleen took it into her head that she might as well stroll towards the school.
This she did very briefly.
She had not yet had a full and perfect view of Kathleen.
There was no rule against any one attending the school, and he had long ago secured a niche in it for his favorite daughter.
Before any one could reply to her, however, a servant entered and said something in a low tone to Miss O'Flynn.
"She's taking no end of a fancy to me.
She was always a rare one to see a good balance at the end of the week.
He talked about you a little.
"Let me in at once, Kathleen," she cried.
I shan't be a minute in the old place before the salt breezes will blow England out of my memory.
I told you how that night when I had the misfortune to go and see your aunt and look after her sick child, some one came into the shop and stole nineteen-and-sixpence out of the till.
He thought it would be very good fun to tell the other fellows about the charming Irish girl who liked him so much.
Tennant, who had been suffering from headache, and was in consequence a little late for breakfast.
Didn't you see her go?
No one could help giving her a most sincere respect.
But you are a good child.
"I wish--" she said suddenly.
You see, Alice, however cross you are, I'd have the others all on my side.
She told me--Miss Ravenscroft did--because she likes you, Ruth, and she would be so terribly sorry if you got into trouble over this matter.
You wouldn't think so, would you, miss?" "It gives her great credit," said Kathleen in a calm voice.
His wife was an Irishwoman from a neighboring county, and had some of the most careless attributes of her race.
Do not suppose that I want you to be a spy in this matter, but what is troubling the school must be discovered, and within the next few days.
Florence was pretty and clever, but she had neither Cassandra's depth nor power of intellect.
Do you think I'd do anything to endanger my continuing at the school, after all the trouble and care and anxiety you had in getting me placed there?" "Really, child," said Mrs.
I can't go at all now." "But why, darling?" said Kathleen.
I had hoped to spare you this, but if you defy me you know the consequences." "May I go now?" said Kathleen.
Why isn't she here?" "I am very sorry indeed," said Alice; "it isn't my fault." "We won't talk of faults, if you please, Alice Tennant.
The other ladies also looked as they usually did, except that Mrs.
Isn't she going with you?" Alice threw up her hands.
Hopkins had time to utter a word with regard to this preposterous and appalling suggestion of Aunt Church's, there came a loud knock on the little street-door, and, listening in the parlor, the people within could distinctly hear the rustle of silk petticoats.
I hope you have carefully considered the position and are prepared to act openly and honorably.
And I won't take it off." Just then there were voices, and Aunt Church called out: "Where are you, Mary Hopkins?
"It is to-night we are to meet again, and she says she will bring the rules all drawn up, and she will read them to us.
"Mother must be in soon.
"You know what it will mean if you tell?" Ruth's grave eyes were fixed on Mrs.
Grandfather is not well, and I must hurry back to him." "Your nice white-haired grandfather that you have talked to me about?" "He was ill all night.
For instance, the house where the Weldons lived went by the ambitious name of Sans Souci.
Susy, you had better not miss it to-morrow night, for Aunt Katie O'Flynn is to be present, and there's no saying what she will do.
Presently she uttered a little shriek.
I want to go to Mrs.
Really she felt herself quite rising in the social scale as she saw her old relative dressed in her best, with the manners she used to wear when she was housekeeper at Lord Henshel's, and with that most appetizing, most _recherché_ tea on the table.
And just as Susy looked up Kathleen looked up, and the latter burst into a loud laugh, and said: "I do declare there's a boy in there." The next instant she had burst into the bedroom and dragged Tom out.
I come from the land of the mountain and the stream; of the shamrock; of the deep, deep blue sea." "Ireland?
Presently she heard the clock outside strike seven.
Perhaps the poor tired one would like to have a pleasant afternoon in my bedroom.
Oh, there she is!" "Kathleen, Kathleen!" called out Alice.
"And what can a poor body like me do to help her?
She offered me a very great help.
Perhaps I had better leave the school." "No, Kathleen, you cannot leave it in the ordinary way.
"Is that a slap at me?" she asked.
Weldon could scarcely talk of anything else.
"I don't hold with it, but then it's the way of the missis." "I have got some money in my pocket," said Kathleen.
Dear, she did seem in a state!
"Have a cup of tea; it will help you to think more than anything," said Susy, and in a brisk and businesslike fashion she dived into the cupboard, took out the cups and saucers, a little box of biscuits, a tiny jug of milk, a caddy of tea, and proceeded to fill the little teapot.
There will be about forty of us altogether." "We are sure to be found out.
He was holding out his thin, knuckly hands to the blaze.
"Mother," he said, "I have done everything splendidly; and she's coming to dine with us to-morrow." "She's what?" said Mrs.
Will you let me teach you the business, and save up all the money I can for you to sell groceries on a bigger scale?
Church," said Kathleen, "you are perfectly sweet, and I can't tell you how grateful we are; but we are in something of a hurry, so perhaps you wouldn't mind telling the rest of that story about butter and honey to Aunt Katie when you are in Ireland.
It would send you, with a little help from your grandfather, perhaps to Holloway College, perhaps to Somerville or Newnham, or even Girton.
"Just this once," she said; "but you must begin to practice properly.
he is changing it now into 'St.
I am going to supper to-night with Cassandra Weldon." "Then you don't get in," whispered Kathleen to herself.
I am expecting to have the most wonderful joy all the afternoon that was ever given a girl.
By-and-by she saw a girl walking leisurely up the road; she was a shabbily dressed and rather vulgar girl.
Susy left the room with the kettle.
"Well, I am coming to the great news.
Whom were these exquisite creations meant for?
And the microscope should be out handy and in order, and with some prepared plates that my poor husband used, which I have never shown to anybody from the time of his death.
I did not care for the society, although I love her.
"But what is it, dear?" "You will know soon enough, mother." "That is exactly what you said to me upstairs," said Kathleen, driven desperate by Alice's manner.
Susy, who had been crying in the shop, also appeared on the scene.
She has fallen from her horse and has concussion of the brain.
He has a headache and is lying down upstairs.
She looks, oh, so thin and so tired!
She found it quite full.
It was a mad and silly scheme.
She is no more tired than--than other women are." "If that is the case," said Kathleen, "I heartily hope that I shall not live to be a woman.
What am I to do about Cassandra and about Alice?" "You think a great deal about Cassandra, don't you?" "Oh, yes; she is quite a splendid girl, and she has been so very good to me." "I suppose you are quite in love with her?" "No, I don't think I am.
Her delicate white fingers trembled for an instant on the keys.
Don't forget that the step just before you reach the upper landing gives a great creak like the report of a pistol; hop over it on to the landing itself, and you are safe.
You tell her you got it at a cheap sale.
Your Alice won't like me; and, to be frank with you, I don't like her.
Girls, I will tell you the truth.
He took a seat at the table, and gazed with wonder, delight, and admiration at Kathleen.
God bless you, my darling!
There's a good child, Susan; take it out and fill it at the tap, and put it on the fire to boil up while you are telling me the rest of the story.
"I presume I am talking to Miss O'Flynn?
You couldn't but love her if you saw her.
Alice downstairs felt like a caged lion.
Tennant's house." When Kathleen received the communication her eyes flashed with delighted fire.
Miss Ravenscroft meanwhile stood waiting.
"The first question I have to ask," said Miss Mackenzie, "is this: How many of the foundation girls have joined the rebels?" Ruth came a step nearer.
"Then you don't look it.
I don't want anything that you have to offer me.
I brought pretty Ruth Craven with me.
But you are all right; you haven't an idea of scolding me.
She saw Kathleen, observed her panting for breath, and stood directly in her path.
Cassandra had spoken to her mother, and her mother had agreed that Ruth might come back with her each evening and also take advantage of the services of Miss Renshaw.
"You haven't been to see mother for a long time, and if you ain't got any money to buy a dinner for yourself, it is but fair you should have a slice off our Sunday joint." "Sunday joint, indeed!" snapped Mrs.
Fine feathers make fine birds.--Come over and speak to me, my dear, and help me out of this chair.
Those horrid, stuck-up paying girls don't want you; and we do.
I'd like to do it.
Now she seemed to awaken and pull herself together.
She removed the beautiful blouse and put on a common one.
Her real feelings she never told; her real hopes she never breathed.
"If you want your share of the room, I want mine.
"I am doing all this for you, you know, because I am sorry for the foundationers, and think it so very ridiculous that there should be distinctions made.
"Well, Ruth," she said, "have you decided?
On the contrary, she took her hand and pressed it.
Cassandra glanced at her, uttered a quick sigh, and resumed: "Whether you like it or not, I am glad you are out of the whole thing.
But Susy pushed past Tom and held out her hand.
It is a fine day, child, and your cheeks look very fresh.
"Miss Mackenzie bids me say that if the girls who belong to this society will at this moment give up the name of their ringleader they themselves will be forgiven.
Now the question is: Shall I be on the side of the foundationers, or shall I be on the side of the paying girls in the Great Shirley School?" "Indeed, darling," said Rosy Myers, "you shall be on our side.
Her cap was tied with ribbons which had been washed so often that they were no longer white, but yellow.
"I am sure she will get us into trouble.
What is it you want me to do?" "If you will let me come here to-morrow, I'll push you all the way to Merrifield in time for our dinner.
I am so short from the loss of that money that I can't pay Aunt Church for at least another week.
If you have brought the money, Susy, you shall have a cup of tea before you start on your homeward walk.
But a sov.'s worth doing something for.
Tennant spent the afternoon out shopping.
At last the moment of recess arrived.
I'm fresh from old Ireland.
This was no less a person than Miss Kathleen O'Hara, in her Sunday best.
"If there is one thing I am, it is not that," she said.
The disordered state of the room gave evidence of this; and then on a nearer view Mrs.
I'd like to know, and as soon as possible." "We have written about it, Mrs.
Hers was a sort of veiled face; she seldom gave way to her feelings.
You have doubtless indulged in a very free-and-easy and unconventional life in your own country.
Their names were Miss Mackenzie, Mrs.
There is a fire in my sitting-room, and you could come at any hour whenever you have a fancy.
"Oh, Ruth," she said, "will you come to town with me?
I will tell you the news if you will forgive mother." "Well," said Mrs.
I have seen her give hundreds of pounds for one little glittering gem.
Oh, did you ever hear of anything quite so scrumptious?
Naylor, "that for the sake of any chivalrous ideas, quite worthy in themselves, it is a considerable pity for you to spoil your life.
"I mean, you are beautiful for an old lady.
It was a mile away from the sea, and stood on a rocky eminence which overlooked a very wide expanse of moor and wood, rushing streams and purple mountains, and deep dark-blue sea.
She was a well-made, rather pretty girl of fifteen.
Suddenly her eyes brimmed up with tears.
To be expelled meant to deprive them of their chance of being well educated and of earning a decent living by-and-by.
We must worship the beautiful new star from afar.
It isn't everybody who has got loving grandparents like us." "And it isn't many old bodies who have got such a dear little granddaughter," said the old man, smiling at Ruth.

Where is the Métropole?" "In Northumberland Avenue.
What fun that was!" "But she got into terrible scrapes, and was practically dismissed," said Alice.
How am I to manage I don't know.
What do I want to know your sort of things for?
Tennant, "because I think it will help you.
She then went into the dining-room.
I am ever so happy when I am with you.
Nobody for a single moment believed Janey Ford's silly remarks, but nevertheless they gave a sort of thrill to the occasion.
I saw you towering up in the middle of them like a mountain." Kathleen's eyes flashed.
"You see, it was this way.
Please write down, Miss Judson"--here she turned to the clerk--"that Ruth Craven has refused to answer my question with regard to Kathleen O'Hara.
Ruth had enjoyed her hour with Miss Renshaw, and was altogether in high spirits.
"It will be all right," she said.
The girls parted at the next corner.
My word, this is a nice state of things!
They had to walk across a very wide field, then down a narrow lane, then up a steep hill, and then into a valley.
She would willingly have given all her father's wealth--and he was quite well-to-do for his class--- to have Cassandra's face, Cassandra's voice, Cassandra's figure.
"Well," she said, "here we are, and we call ourselves the Wild Irish Girls.
I want to introduce you to aunty.
The telegram, not a long one, was from her father: "Have just seen Aunt Katie O'Flynn.
Kathleen next handed a slightly handsomer badge, but with exactly the same device, to the members of her Cabinet.
She'll get me more than I can wear.
"And bought with her own hard-earned savings.
Tennant, who was really feeling very angry, could prevent her, had flung her arms round her neck.
My name is Susan Hopkins.
"I feel like a queen-bee that has just swarmed," she remarked _en passant_ to Cassandra Weldon.
Whatever you do, Kathleen, you must not encourage them in their larks." "But why shouldn't I?
O'Hara, and she wrote to Miss Ravenscroft and asked if there was a vacancy for Kathleen, and if she knew of any one who would be nice to her and with whom she could live.
They get six shillings a week each, and a dear little house to live in.
Church's house was flat and long and pleasant to walk on.
And besides that, her father has an awfully old castle in the south-west of Ireland.
I want to speak to them both.
"What can have ailed Aunt Katie to betray me in such a fashion?" she thought.
"How stupid I am!" thought the little girl.
He took it out and looked at it; he turned it round and round and examined it all over.
Kathleen herself was in the midst of the light, and the other girls clustered round the edge.
"I mean to enjoy myself," said Kate Rourke.
You will keep your promise and come and have tea with us, won't you?" "I am very sorry, but I am afraid I can't.
"As though I had not done right--as though I had something to conceal.
"I promised to frank them, and I must frank them," thought the girl.
What sort of trouble can she get into?" "There are whispers about her that I don't quite understand.
Oh, you poor girl, how tired you look!" Maria, whom Alice never noticed, looked with adoring eyes at beautiful Kathleen.
Tennant looked grave, but it was difficult to resist Miss O'Flynn, and the time was passing.
And what do you think?
I don't suppose they are all ladies." "Well, you are, anyhow, my little Ruth." "Am I, granddad?
Perhaps I am a bit wild sometimes, but your way would never drive me to work or anything else.
You are so clever, and so different from the others, that you are certain to succeed.
I'd quite forgotten all about it.
Isn't this a perfect duck?
"Well, it looks rather like it," said Susy.
if I could only show my sweet, sweet little badge," she thought, "it would make me perfect.
Susy shall have my good graces if she has secured those of Miss Kathleen O'Hara." Accordingly, Mrs.
But Kathleen was enjoying herself to the utmost.
Often at home I go off with my boy cousins, and we have such a good feed.
Sometimes a girl would put her hand up to her neck in a somewhat significant way, and another girl would respond with a similar signal.
To-day, however, all was peace and quiet.
"I don't understand impertinent questions, and I expect the schoolgirls to be orderly.--Ah, Ruth Craven!
Aren't you awfully frightened?" "Not I," said Kathleen.
About a week after her arrival at Myrtle Lodge the box which Aunt Katie O'Flynn was sending from Dublin arrived.
But no remark was made, and the meal came safely to an end.
That sort of thing I should think even the Great Shirley girls would not attempt.
"I have no doubt," said Kate, "that Cassie will take her up." She said the word "Cassie" in a loud voice.
She called Tom to her side.
The moment I saw you I knew that you were my affinity.
She mustn't go; I can't allow it.
It means--oh, it means all the difference in your whole life." "I know," said Ruth.
"Don't keep me now, Kathleen; I want to get into school in good time.
They left messages, and I have forgotten them.
Those who are present to-night will be in my Cabinet.
And did you, when you were like that, submit to being tied up in steel chains all round every bit of you?
"Where can she be?" thought Alice.
"And so that is what the governors are doing--horrid, sneaky, disagreeable things!
The Irish girl's name is Kathleen O'Hara, and she comes from a castle over in the wild west of Ireland.
The two other girls burst out laughing.
Whatever happens, you have got to be a little servant to me and a little messenger to your grandfather.
"And that is the sort of girl I have exchanged for daddy and the mother and the boys," thought the Irish girl.
"There are so many different views about riches," she said at last.
Oh dear, things are turning out lovely!
His forehead was broad and slightly bulgy; his carroty hair was cut short to his head.
You sold, according to your own showing, a penn'orth of paper, which makes an extra penny; but when I went into the accounts this morning I found that the whole amount was only two pounds one shilling and a halfpenny.
I am very thankful I happened to meet you." "I will see you to-morrow--to-morrow," panted Kathleen.
"I do wish you wouldn't do servant's work," she said.
She rushed on, reached the station, flew up the steps, and found herself on the platform just as the train was coming in.
And now began the real fuss and the real preparation.
There is plenty of humbug in the world; but I don't think I am one.
That is the use of the society as far as I am concerned.
Kathleen gave Maria sixpence for the washing of an extra cloth, and the well-spread table looked quite fresh and wonderfully like a school-feast.
Kathleen threw her arms round her neck and kissed her.
Church with a critical eye.
It doesn't matter this evening." Susy felt vexed; she knew her mother would blame her for sending the ladies away without completing a purchase.
"It is only a very little past half-past eight, and I saw two poor women outside.
"Please," said Kathleen, "we have come to see my aunt, Miss O'Flynn.
"Then I will take my objectionable presence out of your sight.
"It means," said Kathleen, jumping up, "that you are to plant yourself just here, and you are not to stir.
You will not then be able to get the Ayldice Scholarship.
Out of his freckled face there beamed two honest light-blue eyes.
Was she not at this very minute more or less oppressed by a secret fear?
I quite understand from the expression of your face that you are the sort of child who imagines that she is doing right when she keeps back the knowledge which she thinks she ought not to betray; but we governors do not agree with you.
Eventually they got seats in a comfortable carriage, and found themselves going back again to Merrifield.
I wish I had let you in.--She must go, David, the poor dear.
Had he been able to assure Mrs.
"I am desperately sorry, and so is mother." "Eh!
It takes quite thirty-five minutes to get to Charing Cross, and then you have to get to the Métropole.
You are connected with other girls now; your influence must be publicly withdrawn.
Why, I know I shall do very well in the future.
It is true that the bud is rapidly blossoming into most dangerous flower and fruit, but if we are in time we shall stop all further mischief.
Think what a chance is offered you.
"You have come," she said.
I can take you to her house." "But I want Ruth." "If she has taken Ruth home, she will be at Cassandra's house," said Susy.
This is my tea, and Maria fetched it.
"They are all poor," she thought.
"You mean kindly," she said, "but perhaps you had better not.
"Whatever is this, and why is it put here?" said Alice, springing forward to look at the address: "Miss Kathleen O'Hara, care of Mrs.
Kathleen is certain that it would be suppressed if it were known; and it must not be known, for it is the biggest lark and the greatest fun we ever had in all our lives." "Yes," said Rosy Myers; "I feel now quite honored at being a foundation girl." "She does promise us wonderful things," said Kate Rourke.
We might have one English old lady.
Hopkins--she managed to make two ends just meet together, and she always continued to send Mrs.
She doesn't pay any of the fees; she has no pretence to being a lady.
They say she's worth her weight in gold, and that her father is a sort of king in Ireland.
Oh Ruth, don't fail me!" "I won't; but I hate that rule." "And, girls, I think we must part now," said Kate Rourke.
Ruth sat silent, perplexed, and anxious in the midst of the gay feast.
"In addition to everything else, she is quite mean," thought the little girl, and during that morning's lessons she occupied herself far more in flashing angry glances in the direction of Ruth one minute, and at Cassandra the next, than in attending to what she was about.
Mightn't I give the blouse to you first, and you could give it to her?
"My dear, you are not looking too well." "Please do not mind my looks." "It is just this, dear.
"It is influencing a number of girls who can be very easily impressed, and who form a very important part of this school.
She then came to a stile, against which she leant.
"If you are positive that it won't upset Brownie--" "You can lock Brownie up; I will take charge of the key." "And have him grunting like anything." "He won't be heard with forty of them." "It does sound very insurrectionary and wrong," said Mrs.
The houses were very compact; they were new, and were called by ambitious names.
we will have a time.
Would Miss Kathleen O'Hara take so much notice of me if I was not a very nice, lady-like sort of a girl?
Would you like to come?" "That I would." "I'll write to father and ask him if you may." "Miss, it would be wonderful." "You'd be very picturesque amongst them," said Kathleen, gazing at Mrs.
It came when the girls were at school.
But I like you, honey.
She put the book back into the drawer and locked it.
"Don't do it again, that's all." Kathleen nodded her head, and again buried herself in her book.
We are all coming; not one of us will stay behind.
But as for me, the very lowest position I intend to take in life in the future is that of a teacher.
She'd look so sweet in this pink blouse when she went to tea at her chosen friends.
"What are you doing there?" "The outside of this door doesn't belong to you," called David, "and if I like to whistle through the keyhole you can't prevent me;" and he began "Garry Owen" again.
"Of course I will face the governors.
And, do you know, before you came in Aunt Church was so horrid.
"Why, Ruth," said Cassandra, "what is the matter with you?
It is a badge, and means a great deal," she said to herself, and she closed her hand over it as she lay in bed.
"Oh, there never was such a lark!" "Nothing could happen to forty of us," said Kathleen.
Maybe there will be something here to fit you, Alice.
On Saturdays school was over a little earlier than other days.
If Ireland is your native land, England is ours, and we cannot help loving her very, very much." "You have never known Ireland," continued Kathleen.
You gave me a terrible fright.
Remember that what I have said to you is said in the interest of the school, and absolutely behind closed doors.
Hopkins, "that that pretty young lady happened to call!
Tell her that I will go a bit of the way towards her house; tell her that I will be at the White Cross Corner at a quarter to nine.
I will make myself a fresh cup." Susy stood still for a moment.
You had best let me go, mother.
It seemed absurd to see this tall, well-grown girl surrounded by tiny tots.
Is it true that you encourage certain girls in this school"--here Miss Ravenscroft put up her hand to check Kathleen's words--"to rebellion and insubordination?" "I don't know what insubordination is," said Kathleen, shaking her head.
"Spend your money on buying food for us.
"Don't mind me," she said, whispering to David as she bent towards him.
She doesn't think anything of birth, nor of those sort of tiresome distinctions; she thinks of you for what you are worth yourself.
She has locked the door of their mutual bedroom, and declines to open it; she says that as the door happens to be in her half of the room, she has perfect control over it." David whistled.
I asked Aunt Katie O'Flynn to send it to me for your mistress, but your mistress doesn't care for it.
Aunt Katie O'Flynn's the one for extravagance, bless her!
"Now I must rush back to dinner.
I wonder where the old quarry is," she thought.
"I don't know the meaning of the word.
Nobody knew how it had been done, and nobody had the least idea who was the thief.
I assure you there are only two pounds one shilling and a halfpenny in the till.
Kathleen O'Hara clung to Ruth Craven's arm; she kept talking to her and asking her questions.
Personally I am pleased with you.
Her name is Cassandra Weldon." "One of our best and most promising pupils," interrupted Miss Ravenscroft.
If so, will they hold up their hands?" Immediately a great show of hands was visible.
She went to their mutual room, and turned the key in the lock.
"Whatever is the hour, child?" "It is going on for six o'clock; and they will be here at half-past seven at the latest." "Very well," said Tom; "if I must go I will have a talk with Brownie." He looked at Susy as if he meant to defy her, but Susy was too wise to anger him at that moment.
It opens up scholarships--many scholarships--of great value for those special girls who call themselves foundationers.
I can tell you there wasn't much freedom about that; it was all horrid." "Well, we have shops in Ireland too," continued Kathleen, "and I suppose people have to mind them.
She was shaking with her quick run.
What did she say?" "That is my affair.
By the express order of the founder, the governors were women; and very admirably did they fulfil their trust.
Which hat did you say--the one with the blue scarf round it?
"Forgive me," she said; "I see that you and your companions are schoolgirls, are you not?" To some people Kathleen might have answered, "That is our own affair, not yours;" but to this lady with the courteous face and the gentle voice she replied in quite a humble tone: "Yes, madam, we are schoolgirls." "And if you will forgive me, dear, have you no lady looking after you?" "No," said Kate Rourke, bending forward at that moment; "we are out for a spree all by our lone selves." Kate gave a loud laugh as she spoke.
Miss Renshaw will coach you and me together.
"But of course Ruth will get her scholarship," she said to herself.
What a worry that is!
It is wonderful how smart they look." "They are very lucky ladies--very lucky," said Mrs.
Rose produced a packet of sticky sweetmeat, and a moment later the four were sucking peppermint toffee and making themselves thoroughly objectionable to their neighbors.
I should like to have what information you can give me.
Here, do you think you'd like this in your possession?" As Kathleen spoke she held out a golden sovereign in the palm of her little hand.
Tom Hopkins and His Way with Aunt Church 136 XIII.
She had two hours' hard work before her, and it was already nearly six o'clock.
"I do think somehow, Kathleen, that they will catch us in the long run.
She came from the south-west of Ireland.
You can rest quite satisfied on that point." "You are a splendid, darling brick," said Kathleen, "and I love you to distraction.
Surely after Saturday no girl who belonged to the Great Shirley School would like to speak to her.
I thought I was back in the shop again.
I am not talking without knowledge, and I can't tell you what I know." "I know something," said Tom, and he gave utterance to a low whistle.
"I am quite taking to you, Susy," she said.
"I'm not going to peach, of course; only you'd best look out.
He was a good landlord, firm but also kind and indulgent.
They had a pleasant meal together, and Ruth tried to forget that she had absolutely quarrelled with Kathleen, and that Kathleen's heart was half-broken on her account.
how am I ever to get the names of half of them round my tongue?
I saw Kathleen for a few minutes this morning, and she said that she had twelve applications for badges already to-day, but she told the new girls that they had best not come to the meeting to-night, as there wouldn't be room for them.
And granny will be still more vexed.
"Really this is provoking." "Oh, mother, it isn't worth while fretting about her.
May I call you Kathleen?" "Just as you please, Susan.
She had shaded the light from what she supposed to be the sleeping girl, and got into bed herself feeling tired and sulky.
The others are fond of me; they don't think me perfect--and indeed I don't want them to--but they love me for those qualities in me which are worthy of love." "How you chatter!" said Alice.
Her speech was not loud, but it could be heard to the end of the great hall.
Once the train was in motion all would be safe; they might meet then and talk and be merry to their hearts' content.
When the contents of the trunk had been finally explored, Kathleen began to sort her finery.
The boys were also in the highest good-humor; Kathleen's mirth was contagious.
It is time to get up, after all." The girls dressed in silence.
Tennant was smiling and looking just as usual, and the boys were as fond of Kathleen as was their wont.
The scene was vivid and picturesque.
I spent a month in Dublin, and I bought the very best paper for packing my sugars and teas in that I ever came across.
Alice was standing in the dining-room devouring a book of Greek history.
She will be sorry some day.
I mean to work as hard as ever I can.
After a brief hesitation she entered the house, and was conducted across the narrow hall into a very sweet and charmingly furnished room.
And the governors and the head-mistress sent for this girl and asked her to betray her companions--those girls to whom she had sworn fealty--and the girl refused." "Quite right," said old Mr.
Such a girl as that is a firebrand in a school, and however rich she may be, and however well-born, the sooner she leaves us the better." CHAPTER XXI.
"I have been to a theater twice before.
She thought a good deal of herself, for her father was a rich man, and only took advantage of the Great Shirley education because it was incomparably the best in the place.
It is a sort of Manifesto of Independence, that is what it is, girls, and I want to know if you will stick to it." All the hands were raised up at this juncture, and all the voices said: "Yes, yes, yes." "That's splendid," said Kathleen.
"Where are you going, Dave?" asked Kathleen in an interested voice.
Well, mother, to avoid all these consequences I must go as fast as I can to see Aunt Church." CHAPTER XVIII.
He is dead and in his grave; but he had white, white hair like yours.
"Cassandra Weldon would never take the very least notice of me; and none of us foundation girls like her at all." "Well, it is extremely unfair," said Kathleen.
But he was a commissioned officer in the Punjab Infantry.
I have my society and--and the school." "Well, then, stay, love; only don't keep me now.
I shall probably have to return through the bedroom window, so I may as well explore and make all in readiness.
Hopkins awaited her with a tray full of good things.
Surely you are not frightened.
It was just sweet of her to get things like this to give us.
Over her showy dress she wore a long opera-cloak, so that at first her splendors were not fully visible.
She did not care a bit for Susy; but being a member of the Wild Irish Girls, and not only a member, but one of the Cabinet, she must on all occasions be kind to her.
In the morning Alice called out to her: "Is your headache better?" "Had I one?" began Kathleen.
He bent down now and whistled very softly, and in the most flute-like manner, "Garry Owen" through the keyhole.
Round her neck was a collar of old Mechlin lace; she wore cuffs of the same with ruffles at the wrist.
Miss Mackenzie, as though she had not heard the voice of her sister governor, proceeded: "What is the name of the founder of the society?" "I am not prepared to say," replied Ruth.
Her nose was decidedly snub, her mouth wide; but her eyes were dark and bright, and she had fairly good eyebrows.
This is awful!" "I don't see why you should go, Aunt Katie," said Kathleen.
When I was young I knew a little girl, and you remind me of her.
I was up, my dear; I had taken a bit of a walk, and I came in and sat down by the fire.
After a time, however, she uttered a sigh.
"Now, Kathleen," said Miss O'Flynn, "you come straight up to my bedroom, where there is a cosy fire, and where we will be just as snug as Punch.
Squash the whole thing at once, or expect my serious displeasure.--O'HARA." "Is there an answer?" asked David.
There never was a more affectionate, more generous-hearted girl than Kathleen; but of self-control she had little or no knowledge, and those who crossed her will had yet to find that Kathleen would not obey, for she was fearless, defiant, resolute--in short, a rebel born and bred.
You say these girls meet in a quarry?" "I have heard rumors to that effect." "Do you think they meet there every night?
It is true they were to buy their own in the first instance, but Kathleen was to return them the money in the train.
If they all like me, why shouldn't you?" Alice made no reply.
Let me see; what hotel is she going to?
Soon after dinner Ruth walked over to Cassandra's house.
"It would get a beautiful meal; and the poor missis, she would like it." "Then go out, Maria; do, like a darling.
Those who know Ruth Craven, hold up their hands." Immediately there was a great show of uplifted hands.
If you put your heart at the feet of a body in old Ireland, that body doesn't kick it away.
She flung down her books and looked across the room.
"They have come," said Susy, her face white as a sheet.
You can go to your horrid, stupid lessons if you like, but it won't be Kathleen O'Hara who will accompany you.
"Come, Kathleen; I am waiting," said Alice in a slightly cross voice.
"You are not cramped up in that favored spot; you are allowed to get up when you like and to go to bed when you like, to eat what you like, to read what books you like, to row on the lake, to shoot in the bogs, to gallop on your pony over the moors, and--and--oh, to live the life of the _free_." It was Ruth Craven who now interrupted the eager words of the queen of the new society.
It would be so nice if you would.
I trust when I am forty I shall not want a crutch.
Once a week they were to meet in the quarry; once a week, whatever the weather, in the dead of night, they were to meet in this sequestered spot.
The governors convened a special meeting yesterday; they had Ruth before them, and then tried by every means in their power to get her to tell.
If you are going out, it ought to be to church.
Kathleen, when she entered the school and started her society, had not the slightest idea that, while she was trying to help the foundationers, she was really leading them into very grave mischief.
Of course, as you know, Miss Mackenzie, such proceedings are altogether prohibited in our school." "But this takes place out of school," said Mrs.
"Then that clinches the matter.
The rest of the girls proceeded to their different classes, and Cassandra found herself in Miss Ravenscroft's presence.
I lived with the quality for so long.
hurrah!" The whole eight immediately broke into a ringing cheer.
"I won't ask you to do any more to-day," she said.
My dear girls, you have all been summoned to attend in this hall to-day in order to meet the governors of the school, Miss Mackenzie, Mrs.
You just have your pension from the Government, which don't count for nothing at all." Ruth rose to her feet.
I never had all that lot of bullion in the whole course of my life before.
She makes you see a thing at the first glance.
The table looked, as Tom expressed it, "very genteel." Then the provisions were placed upon the board.
Kathleen sat quite still for a minute until she had recovered her breath.
"I can have a look at your books while I am waiting, can't I, little woman?" said the old man.
She went to a side entrance, where a woman she knew served her with what she required.
"Thank goodness it is you!" said the young girl.
Wasn't it awful of her?
"It is my painful duty," she said, "to have to say something which distresses me far more than I can give you any idea of.
However, I needn't worry you about that.
"You don't know what it would mean to me," answered Miss Spicer.
The next day the suppressed excitement in the school grew worse.
Some instinct told the wild, ignorant child to dress quietly.
THE QUEEN AND HER SECRET SOCIETY.
What is the matter, Mrs.
Tennant is not angry with you now, Kathleen.
That is the real joy of it.
Hopkins, "but I confess I don't know anything about him." "Well, he and his old wife have got this one beautiful grandchild, and she has joined the foundationers at the Great Shirley School.
Did you ever in all your life see any one look more splendid than Kathleen as she stood with the light of those big lamps upon her?
But I suppose they were on the right side; only I do sometimes hate being on the right side.--Don't you, Kathleen?" "Yes," said Kathleen in a whisper, and she squeezed Susy's hand.
She was more and more certain that she had done wrong to listen to Kathleen's persuasions.
Why, nothing holds her in bounds; there's nothing she stops at.
"It is Kathleen O'Hara;" "It is Kathleen O'Hara herself;" "Well, she has come at last;" "Yes, it is Kathleen O'Hara," passed from lip to lip, until Kathleen felt that her name had got round her and above her and to right and left of her.
It will be very painful, but it must be done." "I will do what I can," said Miss Ravenscroft; "but from the little I have seen of Ruth, I imagine she would go to the stake before she would betray those who are kind to her.
I feel in your dull old England as though I were in prison.
"It's only me, miss," said Kathleen, "so don't blame any of the other innocent lambs.
Tennant, with a smile; "but as a matter of fact I am not forty yet." "Not forty!" said Kathleen.
But I want you to improve; I want you to be a credit to me." "I'd like to please you, of course," said Kathleen.
Alice came up as far as the tree; she paused a minute and looked around her.
Will you and I go there for an hour or two after supper?" "Do you mean it?" said Kathleen, her eyes filling with laughter, and the tears still wet on her cheeks.
Now that's about all.--Pull away, Tom, my boy.
We can't always meet at night, but we will when it is possible, for this place is so romantic, and so correct for a secret society.
Presently Cassandra slipped her arm round Ruth's waist.
There is some commotion in the school in connection with her.
I have a bag full of them here.
It would be too terrible to see you denounced in the presence of the whole school, and sent out of the school for ever.
I want you to be my Prime Minister, I want you to be with me in all things." "I don't know that I can." "And why should she be your Prime Minister?" said Kate in an ugly voice.
Patrick's Day,' Wisha, then, daddy!
Alice Tennant was standing by herself; she looked dull and depressed.
At the other side of the common was a long, narrow, winding passage which, after a quarter of a mile of tortuous turning, led right up a back-way to the great terminus.
"I can't possibly fail Kathleen," she said to herself.
I am very sorry, but I don't think that I was made to suit a great school like this, and I give up the society--yes, absolutely--so you won't have any rebels present in your midst again.
Tom was the one who generally ran across to the old lady's with the money; and so fond was she of him that she often gave him a piece of cake, and even on one or two rare occasions kept him to dinner.
The most wonderful, delightful chance is offered to us.
Oh, how long the morning is!" Just then a teacher came out and beckoned to Kathleen.
here she comes, and your little friend, Miss Craven, with her." Ruth, looking very pretty, with a delicate flush on each cheek, now entered the room in the company of Cassandra.
Even for the paying girls the expense for all they receive is but a trifle.
"Don't you know anything?" "I?
It's a wonder I could come at all," said Susy.
And some of the English people are very nice entirely," said Miss O'Flynn, making this last statement in what she considered a widely condescending manner.
Again she would lead the tender and solemn strains of the march; and again she would dance over the keys so lightly, so ravishingly, that the girls kept time with their feet to her notes.
Her sentence will be proclaimed in the presence of all the school, and she will be watched walking out of the schoolroom and out of the big gates, which will close behind her for ever, and all her chance goes--all her golden prospects.
The enthusiasm, which had been extremely keen before the appearance of the blouses, now rose to fever-height.
That horrid Alice--Alice Tennant--ran after me as I was leaving the house.
But each foundation girl--at least each who had joined the Wild Irish Girls--pressed her hand against the front of her dress, so as really to be certain that the little locket, the dear little talisman of her order, was safe in its place; and each girl felt naughty and good at the same time, anxious to please Kathleen and anxious to adhere to the rules of the school, and each girl resolved that, if she had to choose between the school and Kathleen, she would throw the school over and give allegiance to the queen of the society.
I wrote to her also.
"Oh, dear, my heart is in my mouth!
Hopkins, "I wouldn't have thought it of you." "Why, what is it, mother?" "There's nineteen-and-sixpence taken out of the till," said Mrs.
"What's that?" "It's what you ought to have, Tom, and it's to be hoped you will have it when the time comes." "Looks like it!" cried Tom, rubbing his hands in a meaning way.
Her beautiful little face was beginning to have its usual effect upon most of the ladies present.
The old man's large clear blue eyes were fixed on the child.
There was no crowd at the theater this special evening.
The only girl in the whole of England that I love has slighted me.
Please let me have one." Kathleen did not wait for Mrs.
"Tom," she said, "you must go and see Aunt Church this afternoon as soon as ever you come in.
Miss Mackenzie bent forward and made some notes in a little black book which she held upon her lap.
Mother is rather worried about money just now.
"Oh, let me pass!" she said.
She then flung herself on the bed, put her two arms under her head, and gazed out of the window.
She looked back, and caught the eyes of at least a dozen of those foundationers whom she had pitied and helped and been jolly with.
Perhaps Aunt Church will be a little nicer to me now that you have taken her up.
Church raised her wrinkled old hand and laid it for a minute on Tom's forehead.
The number of pupils was limited to four hundred, one hundred of which were foundationers and were not required to pay any fees; the remaining three hundred paid small fees in order to be allowed to secure an admirable and up-to-date education under the auspices of the great school.
As if I'd demean myself by taking a place!
Cassandra laid her hand on her arm.
I am sorry he is so bothered about the accounts, but perhaps that phase will pass." "He is so pleased about you and the scholarship." "Yes," said Ruth.
You are very good indeed, aunty, and mother will be so pleased.
That is the question." "What do you think yourself?" "I think so; but what does the world say?" "Ruth, I never told you, but your mother was a lady.
He died, and I cried a lot.
"I am sure a sweeter young lady never came into this house." Kathleen chatted on to the retainers, as she called cook and Maria, until she had toasted enough bread.
Tennant, you must come back with me to Carrigrohane some day, and then you will have a real rest." Mrs.
Why should I have made myself so terribly obnoxious to you?
"We will go on at once without waiting for the others," said Cassandra, and they walked on quickly, while Kathleen searched in vain for her chosen friend.
I had a good time.
On the contrary, I am kind-hearted; but I can't stand the sauce of that little girl of yours.
"We will go to-morrow evening.
"Sausages," she said, bringing out the word with great gusto, "and shrimps, and water-cress, and sardines, besides bread-and-butter galore, and nice hot tea.
You will, won't you?" "Thank you very much," said Ruth.
"I hope to do wonders there.
Tennant, let us come and examine everything.
And what does dress matter?
It did not occur to her to examine its contents, or to suppose for a single moment that any one had taken money out of it.
These were brief enough: "To inquire into the insurrection amongst the foundationers, and in particular to cause full investigation to be made with regard to the Irish girl, Kathleen O'Hara." "This is really very astonishing," said Miss Mackenzie, turning to the other governors.
Thus you would very quickly get to the head of your class, and get your removes without trouble at Christmas." "I suppose you mean to be kind," said Kathleen.
The face that met hers was so appealing and loving that she could not resist saying a word.
For Kathleen had discrimination; it mattered nothing to her whether a girl paid or did not pay for her lessons, whether she belonged to the despised foundationers or was respected and looked up to by paying girls.
"It is not to be thought of.
"Hall-marked and all!" she said.
Now then, let me help you.
"I wonder if she's up to mischief?" she thought.
"I should prefer that you did not call me Cassie, if you please, Kate.
"She can never be cross, and I like her very much.--Where is the lady?" she added, turning to the waiter.
It is you and me will be the finest of friends, sha'n't we?" Before Ruth could reply the girls had entered the great hall, which presently became quite full.
Then she said: "Very well." Cassandra opened the little gate which led into the tiny fruit and vegetable garden.
Hopkins had no power to stop her.
You must give the whole thing up or you will incur his serious displeasure.
They must get at the truth; they must crush out the insurrection." "But it is turning king's evidence," said the old man.
She has come, the darling!" said Kathleen.
"I am sorry if I am rude and not understood.
"They'll be coming out now," said Mrs.
Who was Hannah Johnson that she dared to speak so rudely to one so charming and beautiful as Kathleen O'Hara?
"Why, you are trembling," she said.
Nothing grew there; the ground was innocent of grass, and much worn by the tramping of young feet.
You are in an awfully low class.
Go on, my child; I'm attending to every word." "The girl decided to accept the kindness from the paying girl, and to do that she had to give up the society.
At a quarter to nine she complained of fatigue, bade Mrs.
It isn't fit for you, Susy; it really isn't.
The Great Shirley School is not meant for rich girls: a girl of the kind you have just described ought not to become a member of the school." "Oh, that is all very fine; but it seems her mother was educated here, and swore a sort of vow that when Kathleen was old enough she should come to this school and to no other.
"I only hope Kathleen won't be in that style." "But do you know anything about her?
I have a plan to propose.--KATHLEEN O'HARA.
She moved restlessly in her bed.
She could not belong to both--to one side of the school and to the other; she must take her stand with one or the other; so she decided for her own special benefit to take her stand with the paying girls." "On the whole, perhaps, she was right," said the old man.
He might in some respects have been an Irish boy himself.
To her the Wild Irish Girls' Society was all that was lovely.
"I am glad," said Kathleen.
Altogether Susy from her waist down was a very ordinary little girl--the little daughter of poor people; but from her waist up she was resplendent.
"You must never part with them, mother," she said--until Tom is married.
Thank you very much." She took the jug and walked carefully back to the cottage.
I do say this is fun." Susy was now quite petted by her companions.
She is in the third remove," replied Miss Ravenscroft, looking with kindly eyes at the child.
She has got the sort of conscience that will worry our queen to distraction.
Go off now, dear, and don't let me find you so troublesome again." Kathleen started off.
The darling girl--I will give her something.
"A whole sovereign," he said to himself--"a whole sovereign, and I never had so much as five shillings of my own in the whole course of my life.
Say you went to a jumble sale and bought it; you paid one-and-twopence-halfpenny for it.
The queen commands that it should be hidden, and the queen's commands must be obeyed." Susy slipped into her blouse.
Susy Hopkins bent her head and sobbed.
"I have not specially noticed you before," she continued, "but after we have each had a good stare we will know what sort of girl you are." For reply Kathleen herself lifted the lantern and flung the full light upon her radiant and lovely face and figure.
"I like a lot of people," she said--"I like Mrs.
I met her last Sunday.
"Come right over here, little girl," said Mrs.
"Now tell me all about it.
Drop it in like a good child, and then you shall shoo the fowls, and have your plumcake, and look in the microscope." "But, Aunt Church--" said Tom.
After a time an elderly servant answered her summons.
Of course there are a lot more members, but our Cabinet has risen to something like a dozen, so I thought I'd have them handy.
It is good to hear two Irishwomen conversing together, for there is so much action in the conversation--such lifting of brows, such raising of hands, such emphasis in tone, in voice, in manner.
The girls streamed into the playground.
"You knew, of course," she said, "how much I love you." "You are awfully good to me, Cassie." "As a rule I am not fond of what schoolgirls call falling in love," continued Cassandra; "but I love you.
"I guessed, of course, that you must be alluding to me," said Kathleen.
The hour was just before dinner, and the wide hall of the hotel was full.
There's no one now to help me with a bit of mending, and all your things are getting so racketed through." "What kept you, mother?" said Susy, ignoring her mother's speech.
He received letter from school-mistress this morning.
You know I like you so much.
Kathleen will get into a serious scrape at the school, that's certain." Alice went to her own part of the room, which was full of order and method.
If I win it I shall be properly educated.
You don't blame me for that, do you?" "No.
Your horrid brooch doesn't interest us.
There never was any sort of conveyance that would frighten me.
"Let us meet her, we seven by ourselves," was Kate's final suggestion.
"It is Ruth I want.
You will be very noble now if you cease to belong to the Irish Girls' Society." "'Wild Irish Girls' is the name," said Kathleen.
"Will you follow me, miss?" she said.
"I can't stand it," she thought.
Ruth was waiting for her just outside the gates.
It would not be a bit wrong of you to come.
Janey Ford trembled all over, and clutched tightly the hand of her companion.
Oh, I'll arrange it, dear; don't you be frightened.
Certainly it was difficult to realize that one at least of that number was determined to have her own way at any cost; that another was extremely anxious, resolved to tell the truth, and hoping against hope that she would not be questioned.
Kathleen could improvise in almost any style, in almost any fashion.
Tennant, it's herself that is crossing, as I said; even now she is in the big steamer, coming nearer and nearer to England.
"Can't say unless I know everything; but on the whole, perhaps, she was right." "I think she was, grandfather," said Ruth slowly.

If no one knew, no one need be at all more sorry or at all more unhappy on account of her action.
"Am not I splendid?" he said.
"Now, Kate Rourke," cried Kathleen, "please take down the names of the girls who intend to become members of the Wild Irish Girls." The girls came forward one by one, and Kate took down their names; and it was quickly discovered that, out of the hundred foundationers who belonged to the Great Shirley School, sixty had joined Kathleen's society.
But I want to see Mrs.
They said, 'We thought you always kept open until nine o'clock,' Now it will spread all over the place that I shut at half-past eight.
She demanded two plates of soup, and when she had finished the second she looked at Mrs.
But when Kathleen was seen going through the gates, her arm flung round Ruth's waist, and all the sixty girls following at her heels, such a cheer went up from the anxious mothers and fathers and brothers--for many fresh people had come to swell the crowd since Kathleen entered the school--as was never heard before in Merrifield.
O'Hara, having heard a great deal of Mrs.
When she returned to the house she found a telegram waiting for her.
"Thank you," said Kathleen, looking round at them, her dark-blue eyes becoming dewy with a sudden emotion.
Oh, no, Alice, I am not ignorant in the true sense; but I hate French, and I hate arithmetic, and I hate all your horrid school work.
I agree with Alice Tennant about her.
What does it mean, in your opinion?" "Oh, Kathleen, can't you understand?
Well, whatever happens, I shall be at the meeting." CHAPTER X.
Think it over, Ruth." "I have thought it over, and I can't do it.
"Well, if that's the case I'm sorry for her," said Kathleen.
"Then I want to find that dear little girl, who is so beautiful that I love her and can't get her out of my head.
But Kathleen herself was determined not to give way to any real feelings of misery on account of Ruth's desertion.
I shall be so miserable with that dreadful Kathleen." "You know quite well, Alice, that that is the only really good bedroom in the house, and I can't afford to give it to one girl by herself.
Hopkins was selling stationery to a couple of boys; she looked up as her daughter entered.
We'll say Wednesday week to receive the money, and I will come over in my bath-chair, drawn by Tom, to take it; and I will give Tom a whole shilling for himself the day I get it back.
The day was as fine as it had been on the previous day, and Susy chattered to her heart's content.
What is that I see?
But I can't now betray those who were my friends.
Hopkins, as she said afterwards, more than a little.
"You see, I am accustomed to him.
What they do at their meetings I cannot tell, but I believe they are very riotous, with singing and dancing and sports of all sorts.
It will be war to the knife between the foundation girls and the good, proper, paying girls.
She herself fetched a plate and the salt-cellar from the dresser, and putting these on the table, helped herself to a potato from the pot.
THE SOCIETY MEETS AT MRS.
Presently she rubbed her cheeks softly against it.
I am certain to get a bad mark for unpunctuality, so I may as well get it looking my best as my worst.
"If Aunty O'Flynn was to look at her Kathleen!
It is much too good to be refused.
She played one or two bars perforce and very badly; then she dashed the sheet of music in an impetuous way to the floor.
You don't know what this means in our lives.
"You are Alice Tennant?" "Yes, madam." "You are in the upper fifth?" "Yes," said Alice again.
The Tennants had their meals in a sitting-room on the second floor.
Would that get her a nice tea?" "A nice tea!" cried Maria.
They went down a passage and entered a brightly and cheerfully furnished sitting-room.
It is the dear woman who sent me the box full of new clothes--Aunt Katie O'Flynn, at your service.
She was afraid just for a moment that she might give way to something, she knew not what, but Alice's look hardened her heart.
There she saw a silent, grave-looking girl, very quietly dressed, standing waiting for her.
They glanced at Cassandra, and then nodded to one another and joked and laughed.
I shall be sorry for her, of course." "But what do you mean?
She is bound on all occasions to behave with sobriety, with a sense of modesty and true womanly feeling; she is never, if she is a true member of the school, to join herself to rebels who do not believe in its rules.
Her face was ghastly pale, and she looked as though she had been crying very hard.
Could she ever forget the fine folk she helped to prepare for in his house?
"And I wish, too, that you wouldn't always be late home.
"I suppose your mother has sent me my money.
Could you not do something to propitiate her?" "Wisha, then, darling!" said Kathleen, pausing a moment to consider; "that's just what I can't do.
I--" "Don't interrupt me, Kathleen; I have more to say.
"But how are we to get there?
"Please," said Kathleen, "will you say that Miss O'Hara has called and would be glad to see Miss Ruth Craven for a few minutes?" The girl withdrew.
"I must get out of the window," she said to herself.
I must do what I can for her." She sat on for some time darning and thinking.
Once she uttered a short, expressive sort of sigh; and once she said half-aloud: "I do hope God will help me.
"You have spoken kind words to me; but what you have set me to do is not at all to my taste.
Susy Hopkins felt quite the happiest and most light-hearted of any.
"I am very sorry you ever came." "Thank you so much, dear." Alice ran downstairs.
Ruth Will Not Betray Kathleen 275 XXIV.
"I must have dreamt it," thought Kathleen.
"Quite an army of them," thought Kathleen.
A very white cloth from Mrs.
She put some autumn leaves in a jug on the center of the table.
She has called it the Wild Irish Girls.
Miss Renshaw would just as soon coach two girls as one, and mother has arranged it.
It is necessary that I should know all that is to be known with regard to the unruly condition of the foundationers of the Great Shirley School.
And this blue bodice is quite nice for the evening, and so is the skirt belonging to it; but this and this and this--I wouldn't wear these until I went home if I were you, my love." Kathleen glanced at her.
for the window of their mutual bedroom was flung wide open, and Kathleen, neatly dressed, appeared on the window-sill.
She was fastening a heavily embroidered coat of blue cashmere when Cassandra accosted her.
"You have heard me?" "Yes, madam." "Kathleen O'Hara is the promoter?" Again Ruth was silent.
I always did since I was a little child.
May I put the account-book aside?" "You may, darling; you may.
Sometimes I think that my burden is greater than I can bear.
"And as you sat in the parlor you could see the shop.
Come along in--do; you must be ravenous." The boys stared at her.
"Do sit down, mother," she said.
If any one appears I can dash out at once." No sooner had the thought come to her than she resolved to act on it.
The boyish face bobbed up now and again, made appealing faces in Mrs.
There are six of us here, and we wish to tell you that if you now refuse the information which we wish to obtain from you, you will do _wrong_.
She offered to give me the services of her coach, Miss Renshaw, to work up for the Ayldice Scholarship.
She should dispense _largesse_ in the true sense of the word.
You told me you would let me know to-day." "I have, Cassandra," said Ruth.
"'Wild Irish Girls,'" she said aloud.
Church, looking round her in some alarm.
Are you on the foundation?" "I don't know what it means by being on the foundation, but I don't think I am poor.
Tell me at once." "Bread-and-butter," said Mrs.
It was rather late when Tom returned home.
Kathleen called to her, made room for her on the same chair, and held her hand.
"Don't be silly; it is absurd for you to go on like that.
The people are as ugly as the country, and they're so stiff and stuck-up.
"Ah!" he said, raising his face when he saw Kathleen.
Don't ring when you come back; just walk up the steps and scratch against the door with your knuckles, and I'll hear you and let you in in a trice.
While Kathleen was locked in Alice's room, she was writing to her father: "MY DARLING DADDY.--If ever there was a cold, dreary, abominable land, it is this where they wave the British flag.
But she has slighted me.
She drew a little nearer to her, however, and fixed her very bright eyes on the girl's face." "But we needn't go to the pit, need we?" she said.
Sha'n't I make them creep?" "It is very silly to talk about ghosts.
Below the name was the device--a harp with a bit of shamrock trailing round it.
I thought you'd like to see her, and I thought granddad would like to see her." "To be sure, child," said Mrs.
I don't want so many frocks: there are a good dozen here all told.
Then she said, speaking aloud: "Girls of the society, Wild Irish Girls, I am sorry to tell you that my aunt, Miss O'Flynn--Miss Katie O'Flynn--who I hoped would have joined our numbers to-night, and would have been a perfect rock of strength for us all, has been obliged to suddenly go back to Ireland, owing to an accident that has happened to her dearest friend." "Dear, dear, how sad!" said one or two.
And I won't show you the beautiful wings of the beetle in the microscope.
But I mean to have my fun to-night." Kathleen quite sobered down as these thoughts came to her.
"We mean the school no harm, and why shouldn't it let us alone?
For a couple of months now he had never sat in the kitchen; he said it caused a buzzing in his head.
My mother is paid by your father to give you your meals; your father doesn't expect you to buy them over again." "Dad always likes me to do what I wish," replied Kathleen calmly.
"She is the most awful girl I ever heard of," thought Alice.
Mother has gone out for the day; we will have a whole delightful afternoon to ourselves.
There was no moon and the night was dark; but one girl had brought a lantern.
"A sweet child, I call her," said Mrs.
If you still persist in keeping your knowledge to yourself they will be obliged to strike your name off the school roll.
She put on her spectacles and read the words, "The Wild Irish Girls, October, 18--." "Whatever does this mean?" she said.
My grandparents cannot make me anything but what I am." Mrs.
We'll have sausages--they are delicious--and a little tin of sardines--won't they be good?--and some water-cress, and some shrimps--oh, yes, shrimps!
Now then, child, don't you worry.
Both boy and girl were in high spirits.
The fascination of the coming sport grew greater as obstacles appeared in the way of its realization.
"Tired one, where are you?" "Kathleen, you ought not to call me by that name.
There was a fire in the grate, and electric light made all things as bright as day.
I am sorry if you think me rude, but I can't help myself.
Be quick now; there's pease-pudding and pork for dinner.
She is worse than troublesome; she is a girl without principle." "Oh, I don't think quite so bad as that, dear," said a gay voice at that moment; and turning, Alice saw the piquant and beautiful face of the girl she loathed.
"Now I want to tell you something," continued Cassandra.
"I am glad to hear it.
We are not so poor as all that.
And there was a thick albert chain made of solid silver for Ben, and a keyless silver watch for David; and what could boys possibly want more?
"The queen must have her way," said Kathleen, stamping her foot.
A hand was thrust into each of his pockets, and these pockets were destitute of coin.
It was on a Wednesday that Susy sat in the parlor and forgot all about the interests of the shop; it was on that very night that the tramp had come in and helped himself to a ten-shilling-piece and some silver out of the till; and it was on the following Saturday that Mrs.
I shall go home to father and mother and tell them I am not suited for a school like this.
Church made the required promise.
She is not my sort.
I am certain she won't." Susy talked a little longer to Kathleen, and finally agreed to take her message to as many of the Wild Irish Girls as she could possibly reach.
"You see, I am a foundationer, and when she pressed me to join I hated not to; but now I am sorry that I have joined.
"Now I shall look stylish," said Kathleen, and she slipped the ring on the third finger of her left hand.
Each one, as they expressed it, had her heart in her mouth.
This road led right into the centre of the shops where Susy's mother lived.
Now I hear Alice's step.
Now there was quite a deficiency last week--the wrong side of the ledger.
Lessons went on in their usual orderly fashion.
Craven, "we must humor him.--Don't you take any notice, Miss O'Hara; don't contradict him, I mean." Kathleen nodded.
She was eccentric and untrained.
Craven, looking up at the eight-day clock which stood in the passage.
"Oh, it was your aunt.
"Come in, Kathleen," called Mrs.
But if it were known that she does lead other girls astray, she would be had up before the governors, and then she would not find herself in a very pleasant position." Ruth did not say anything.
Very angry about Wild Irish Girls.
I trust you with my house and property, and you leave the shop without any one in it Did you lock the till?" Susy had an unpleasant memory of having found the till open when she returned to attend to a customer.
"This is such a lovely day," said Kathleen, "and somehow I feel so downright happy.
Presently Alice ran down the passage.
She had seen, it is true, the pretty little girl in a crowd of others; but now she saw Kathleen by herself.
It will be in extremely bad taste.
In order to do this they must get full particulars.
"Now," she said, "this is good.
The days were getting short and cold, and as the shop door was opened there was a thorough draught where she was sitting.
"Will you have the goodness to stand just here, Miss Craven?" Ruth went to the place indicated.
I'll do it." "Nonsense, granny!
What punishment they receive will only be connected with their work in the school, and may possibly exclude them from competing for certain scholarships during this present term, but for the rest nothing further will be said.
I trust that this extreme step will not be necessary." "If she does not tell us what she knows, it will be not only necessary, but it will be carried into effect, and in my presence," said Miss Mackenzie.
Your grandfather wants his beer.
"I am ever so much obliged to you, miss." "Wisha, then, it is I who like to help you," said Kathleen, "for you look fair beat." She dashed past Alice, and appeared the next moment in the kitchen.
She will give us both an hour.
"So you say, but I don't quite agree with you.
I would if I hadn't promised to go out.
You have come to school to be disciplined.
"And you know the best of the fun is, they are making no end of a fuss in the school.
Shan't we have fun when she arrives?" "You haven't told me who it is yet, dear." "Oh, darling, you haven't been listening.
"I can show the others what I think of them.
Quick as thought she dashed into the kitchen.
"What a good thing," said Susy, "that I took the latchkey with me!
"Now all is well, and I shall sleep like a top until the morning." This, however, was no easy feat.
I am trying for my scholarship, and I mean to get it.
She had large deep-violet eyes, jet-black hair, and a sweet, fresh complexion.
Hopkins, "for goodness' sake, leave the room.--Aunt Church, you know perfectly well that I am not responsible for the naughty ways of that naughty little girl.
You must remember that I saved up for it sixpence by sixpence, and it took me all my time and my best endeavors to get it." "I know it, granny; and when I wear it I feel that you were very kind to give it me.
Craven carried the supper things into the kitchen, and Ruth sat close to her grandfather.
Of course I love you, Cassie.
They are completely out of my control, and I know for a fact that they do not care to please any one except Kathleen O'Hara." "Of course our duty is plain," said Miss Mackenzie.
She had strung narrow green ribbon through each of the little silver hearts, and the girls could therefore slip them over their heads at once.
Ruth would spend the entire afternoon at Cassandra's home.
Stand just there.--Girls, you can all see Ruth Craven, can you not?" The girls held up their hands in token that they could.
The quarry was a little distance away, and she must tidy herself and do all sorts of things.
It isn't the naughtiness that I care about, but it is the fun of being naughty; it is the fun of having a sort of dangerous thing to do.
You couldn't now, I suppose, oblige me with a stamp." "Of course I can," said Susy, cheerfully.
Presently something impelled her to bend forward and touch Kathleen on her arm.
Church's voice was heard in high and grating accents: "I want to see the person who is talking in the passage." "Oh!
"It is getting late, and it would never do for our secret meetings to be discovered." "Whatever happens, we must stick together," said Kathleen.
And what with new-laid eggs, and tea with cream in it, and loaf-sugar, why, I think that's about enough." "So it is, mother; and it's beautiful.
and there's Susy in the distance.
"And I wanted to have her all to myself; I had such a lot to say to her.
I didn't steal the blouse; I came by it honestly, and it wasn't bought out of any of Aunt Church's money." "That remains to be proved," said Mrs.
She looked around her for a minute.
It is spoken of to this day as the greatest and most conspicuous event in the school's history.
Her face was all over wrinkles.
I wish you could have seen me and Rory together at home.
You'd like to trim your hat to match that handsome blouse, wouldn't you?" Susy's eyes could not help dancing.
She is so conceited that she is intolerable." "I heard of her yesterday, but have not had an opportunity to form any estimate of her character," continued Cassandra.
We'll have a good meal presently, and then I have a bit of a thought in the back of my head which I think will please you both.
They will wonder at the beauty of your dress, but they won't know what it means; but _we_ will know," she shouted aloud to her companions--"we will know that these girls belong to us and to old Ireland, and in particular to me, and they will be faithful to me as their queen." "Oh dear," said little Alice Harding, a pale-faced girl, who loved fine dress and never could aspire to it, "what means can I take to become a member of the Cabinet?" "By being a very good outside member, and trusting to your luck," laughed Kathleen.
I only wish that mother had never been induced to take Kathleen as a boarder.
"If I am a chatterbox, you are about the greatest preacher, with the most long-winded sermons, that ever entered a house.
Have you not heard what a condition the school is in?" "I have, of course, heard about the Wild Irish Girls," said Cassandra, lowering her voice.
She was easily influenced by others, and it was her habit to follow the one who gave her the last advice.
It would be cruel to disappoint her.--What dress will you wear?" said Kathleen.
She will not hate you; she will forgive you.
I was once in Ireland, in the west, and I liked the people and the land, and the ways of the people and the looks of the land, and for the sake of that visit I am not going to be hard on a little Irish girl during her first sojourn in the school.
Things ought to be the other way round; it's she who ought to help me." "And so she will, and she said as much.
Besides music, she had worked very hard at botany, at French and German, and at English literature.
Cassandra, with her face beaming as the sun, made a sort of figure-head for the smaller girls.
She was disappointed that she had not seen Ruth; but Ruth had promised to be with her quite early in the afternoon.
"Oh, daddy mine, my heart is sore for you," she was saying in a tone which caused Alice to pause and look at her attentively.
Aunt Church would be very unlikely to get her little almshouse in Ireland, for surely even Kathleen's friends would be very angry with her if they knew.
Sausages ain't worth touching unless you eat them piping hot.
"Ah, then, my dear tired one, it isn't dresses I'll be thinking of when Aunt Katie is in London.
She had a flashing desire to turn tail and run out of the room; but the same power which had pushed her into the room now sent her right up the long central hall past all the watching, expectant, eager-looking girls.
"I called you all to-night to tell you that we are suspected, and we are called insurrectionists; but let them call us what they like." "Please," here put in the timid voice of Janey Ford, "are we likely to be put in prison?
You will understand all too soon.--Kathleen, it is time for us to be going." "I am not going," said Kathleen, "so there!" "Kathleen, you are." "No." "Come, Kathleen; come." "You needn't fuss about me; I am not coming." "Kathleen, dear, I think you ought to go.
He flung the doors wide, and the two entered.
What a detestable voice she has!
"Now my love, tell me, and be quick, about all you have been doing.
"Have you seen Ruth Craven anywhere?" "Oh yes; Ruth has left the school.
It is better for one to suffer than for all to suffer.
"Do wipe your eyes, Susy; don't let her see you crying.
Yes, there was little doubt of it, Ruth was lovable.
Meanwhile Susy entered the house with her mother.
"And I don't see," she added, "why I may not look at any part of my own house that I take a fancy to." "Of course," said Kathleen.
"Well, you know, as I was running here--Oh, girls, I had such a lark!
I suppose it's something a little bit--a little bit not quite good." "It is perfectly good.
Susy was out in a moment.
She took it up and read: "Gone to London to Aunt Katie O'Flynn." "Well, she is a naughty girl.
Are you right now, Kathleen--can you slip upstairs without making any noise?
"Stuck-up thing!" said Clara Sawyer.
I will put the gold and silver in immediately.
Come in immediately and return to your class." "I can't dear," replied Kathleen in a gentle tone.
Yes, I am almost certain.

Church opened her eyes very wide; her mouth formed itself into a round O.
I know it; I am sure of it.
Presently they reached the opening that led into the quarry.
I am going to set some of the foundation girls at that sort of thing.
Do you think you fell asleep over your work?" "Oh, no." "Then it is a mystery past bearing.
It was from Aunt Katie O'Flynn: "I have arrived.
"Can that be the post?" she said; but as no one replied, she forgot the circumstance and went on with her mending.
Oh, the dear tired one!" cried Kathleen.
"And here's a fresh egg for you.
Why, I see sunshine quite plainly from where I am lying.
How dared you go away and hide yourself?
"Never mind; we will go round by your cottage and ask them.
"She wants me to go to London to dine with her to-night.
I wish you would tell me everything.
She lived alone and hoarded her money.
Kathleen began to write, but she suddenly changed her mind.
Kathleen in a breathless sort of way, scarcely uttering a word, spread out her treasures on the bed.
You are good to come.
"When she sees me in that she'll be quite cheered up." The moment she thought of the blouse the little girl felt a frantic desire to run upstairs to look at it.
A hansom was summoned, and the children were put in.
"Don't worry Aunt Church any more.
Evidently there's a great deal of excitement and watching going on in that school." "There will be a great deal of excitement to-morrow," said Susy.
Tell her it's _quite_ new, and was thrown in promiscuous like." "But, my darling child, I can't tell her what isn't true.
She to give up her dear little neat house in this reckless way; she to give up her most precious tea to be absolutely wasted and practically lost--for Kathleen put in quite three times too much tea into the little teapot; she to forgive Susy's mother two months of that debt which she owed her.
Your dear father gave them to me on our wedding-day--a whole dozen of beautiful silver forks with the hall-mark on them, and his initials on the handle of each.
Still, the sense of danger made it all, the more interesting to the children.
"But Alice, it isn't fudge.
She rose to her feet and dropped a little bobbing curtsy, then waited to be asked to sit down again.
When it came to an end David jumped up impatiently.
"Have the girl summoned, please, Miss Ravenscroft." Miss Ravenscroft turned to the clerk, who went away at once in search of Ruth.
It is a chance to get a girl like you, so lovely and so sweet and so rich, to be one of us." "Well, I think I can give you a good time, and I can show those others with their snobbish ways--" "Hear, hear!" cried the excited girls.
"You don't look as if you did.
Do come--do, Ruthie." "But I can't in this dress," said Ruth, who felt suddenly very much tempted.
You, too, are a stranger." "Are you a stranger?" asked Kathleen.
Anyhow, I don't feel quite so bad as before I went to see Miss Ravenscroft." Meanwhile Susy Hopkins was having a busy time.
Do you understand what that means?" "It means that I must go, that I shall lose all the advantages," said Ruth.
shopping, and every conceivable thing that can delight the heart of man or woman, boy or girl, that will be our portion while Aunt Katie--the duck, the darling, the treasure!--is in London.
When I came to your wonderful school and looked all around me, I said to myself, 'If I'm not to have companions, why, I'll die; the heart of Kathleen O'Hara will be broken.
It would be in the worst taste possible to wear anything but the simplest clothes." "All right," said Kathleen.
"A good many people will be saying bad things about Kathleen before long, and perhaps you will be questioned.
"How can Kathleen, who with all her eccentricities is a lady, waste her time talking to an insignificant little girl like Susy?" thought Cassandra.
"What a blessing," said Mrs.
Will you?" "Oh, my word, yes!
Kathleen desired some one to throw the tell-tale box away, and then she collected her followers round her.
I am sure, at least, that you will like the school very much." "Thank you," said the girl again.
Nothing will induce us to give you up.
As long as she could remember, this was the state of things at home.
It seemed to me that I ought to go first to my aunt.
On her way to school she met Ruth.
It's splendacious she is entirely when she's dressed up in her best--velvet and feathers and laces and jewels.
"Ruth," she said, "I don't like your friend Kathleen O'Hara." "But I love her," said Ruth.
The meal was over at the Tennants', but somehow her couple of potatoes had satisfied her.
She held it close to her eyes, which were rather short-sighted.
Why are you in such a hurry?" "I am not," said Ruth, who was not going to get out of her difficulty by telling an untruth.
It was not a very safe place of refuge, for the rafters were rotten and might tumble down at any time.
Can you help me?" "I could," said Alice--"that is, of course, I live in the same house with her--but I would much rather not." "You will in no way be blamed, but it is absolutely essential that you should give me your assistance.
Alice entered and took her seat at the foot.
She will have something to say, and I want you so badly.
The other girls who join the society will be looked after by you; you will instruct them in our rules, and you will help them to be good members of a most important society.
"Dirt beneath our feet!" exclaimed Hannah Johnson.
It isn't my way to fall violently in love with girls, like some of the rest of you.
Some day you will get old yourself, and you won't like people to hate you." "Well, that's a long way off; I needn't worry about it yet," cried Susy.
Here Kate Rourke took the lead.
The day was a frosty one, and the sunset promised to be glorious.
Be as quick as you can, child, or your grandfather won't have his supper in time." Ruth took the money without a word.
I mean to be naughty this afternoon." "I can't help you," said Alice.
There will be no end of a fuss in the school to-day." Ruth did not reply.
A stream of girls were surrounding her, each smiling and trying to draw her attention.
Ruth had been monopolised by Cassandra Weldon.
"I don't know myself," said Alice, "but it has something to do with Kathleen and a curious influence she has over the foundation girls.
"She is very impulsive, but she is------" "Oh, yes," said Cassandra, "she has a good heart, of course; but I foresee that she is up to all sorts of mischief.
These are for the secret society." "The what, Kathleen?" "Oh, you musn't tell--it is the most profound secret--but I have joined one.
Outside some one had said that she would be afraid.
Tennant, who had Irish relatives, decided that Kathleen should go to the Great Shirley School, where she herself had been educated long ago.
Ruth Craven was a member of the objectionable society; she very wisely left it, knowing that she would better herself by doing so.--Now then, Ruth, we expect you to tell us all about the society--where it meets, and as much as you know about its rules.
Don't you, Aunt Katie?" "That I do," said Miss O'Flynn; "and I eat it comb and all.
Church's debtors to eat good roast beef and good boiled pork and good apple-pudding, but it was another thing for Mrs.
"Why shouldn't the child enjoy her pretty things?
I shouldn't be lonely if I were in the midst of the mountains, and if I could see the streams and the blue sea.
"If I appear just as poor as they are, I shall never be able to keep my exalted position as queen.
Her face was beautiful in the truest sense of the world; it did not at all match with the shabby, faded clothes which she wore.
They could go to the quarry to-night and wait there in order to see if the girls arrive.
She was so absorbed in her feelings, and in wondering what would happen during the next twenty-four hours, that she was not attentive at her lessons, and did not notice how the teachers watched her and made remarks.
You have promised to come back with me to the school this afternoon, in order that Miss Spicer may give you a special lesson in music." "Arrah, then, my dear!" cried Kathleen, "it isn't me you'll see at school again to-day.
She put on her hat and jacket, snatched up a pair of gloves, and the next moment was out of the house.
The idea which she had formulated in the old quarry spread like wildfire amongst the foundationers; but Kathleen was determined not to have another meeting for nearly a week.
Alice was there, looking pale and headachy.
Is it true?" Kathleen closed her lips firmly together.
She went downstairs and let herself out of the house.
Come do come." "In a jiff," replied Kathleen.
What a humble abode the prime favorite, Ruth Craven, lived in!
Miss Kathleen O'Hara has taken up with her as well as with me and other foundation girls, and instead of having a miserable, dull, down-trodden life, we are extremely likely to have the best life of any girls in the school.
"To see Miss Ravenscroft," replied Alice.
I'd dress up smart, and take her out, and get her the very best husband I could.
Maybe this very thing can be turned to good for us; there's no saying.
It's to be hoped you will." "Shyness!" cried Tom.
A flash of real anger shot through them.
You'd best come into the shop with me; there's company in the parlor, and I don't think you'd care about it." Kathleen, of course, was just as pleased to stay in the shop with Susy as to go into any other part of the house; but just then Mrs.
Church looked first skeptical, then curious, then keenly desirous.
Will you have it ready for us not later than five o'clock?
"I have found a friend, and I shall have more friends to-morrow.
Soon the three were seated at their frugal dinner.
This was from Dublin, from Aunt Katie herself: "Have told your father.
"I'll tell Miss Kathleen; she will be disappointed, so to speak.
Cassandra went up to her.
"I am sure, whatever her father may be, he can't want her to come to school here to get into endless scrapes.
At eleven o'clock there was a break for a quarter of an hour.
Kathleen O'Hara ran up to an untidy room.
"It is very late, and you are disturbing me." "Yes, mother," called back Susy.
She looked at herself front view, then over her shoulder, then, with a morsel of glass, at her back; she surveyed herself, as far as the limited accommodation of her room afforded, from every point of view.
There are twelve of them, and they all live in their tiny cottages close to each other.
She is a perfect horror," said Alice.
I shall have a broken heart if this sort of thing goes on." She entered the house.
I will cling to these two thoughts, and I don't believe if the worst comes that anything can really hurt me." When she got near the school she was met by Mrs.
I want you to attend to the shop for the next hour.
"You look quite happy, my dear." "And so I am.
By the aid of Tom and Mrs.
Craven, who lives in that cottage close to the station." "A handsome old man, too," said Mrs.
Compared to the other girls in the school, she is ten times a lady; and she has a true lady's heart.
"Half of them are quite commonplace.
"And how did you get on?" asked Alice, noticing the dejected tone of her voice.
Imagery is so freely employed; telling sentences, sharp satire, wit--brilliant, overflowing, spontaneous--all come to the fore.
He got in his rents with tolerable regularity.
I was once in Ireland.
Still, she managed to support herself and Tom and Susy; but it was a scraping along all the time.
It was heard all over the school, and was so imperative, so startling, so unexpected, that even Miss Mackenzie lost her self-control and fell back in silence.
It would be a very terrible thing for me to be expelled from this school; it would mean great sorrow to my grandfather and grandmother; but I cannot betray my friend Kathleen, nor any of the other girls of the society." Miss Mackenzie was silent for quite a minute.
"I see by your manner that you want me to do something.
"I had much rather be a foundationer.
Ruth's Hard Choice: She Consults Her Grandfather 263 XXIII.
The distance from her mother's shop to the Cravens' cottage was a matter of ten minutes' quick walking.
I'll think of it all day, and it will make me so happy." Kathleen dashed away to her own room, put on her outdoor things, and a moment or two later was running as fast as she could in the direction of the White Cross Corner.
Susy rushed upstairs, put on her outdoor jacket and a cheap hat, and, trying to hide the holes in her gloves, ran downstairs.
She forgot the dull school and the dreadfully dreary house where she now lived; she absolutely forgot that such a person as Miss Ravenscroft existed; she ceased almost to remember the Society of the Wild Irish Girls.
She felt pleased and self-important.
"Well, I never!" said Susy.
"You forget that this is Wednesday.
I really wonder if you English girls who are assembled here in the old quarry to-night have the least idea what it means to be a wild Irish girl.
"Anyhow, she wants to befriend _us_--Oh, do let me speak!"--as Kate interrupted with a hasty exclamation.
Aunt Katie O'Flynn has given me some money for that purpose.
"I must ask you not to lock the door.
I always did say what I thought.
Ruth Resigns the Premiership 171 XV.
"Can you give me an exact account of the rules of the society, its motives, its bearing generally?" The same negative reply was the result of this question.
One was a rather plain little girl, the daughter of her own relation; the other was a lady, beautiful, stately, and magnificently dressed.
"You are charming, that's what you are," said Kathleen.
"It means that and more.
Go back immediately." For a minute Kathleen thought of rebelling, but then she said to herself, "It isn't worth the fuss," and returned to her place once again in the centre of the class.
Oh, it is joy to kiss your sweet face again!" A little lady, all smiles and dimples, all curls and necklaces and gay clothing, extended two arms wide and clasped them round Kathleen's neck.
Did you see Miss Ravenscroft last night, and was she very, very angry?" "I saw her, and she was more than angry--she was astonished.
By-and-by tea was ready, and Susy brought a cup to the old lady.
There were heavy feasts in the old hall, and sittings up very late at night, and no end of hunting and fishing and shooting in their seasons.
It had also been whispered from one to another that Kathleen had undergone a formidable interview with Miss Ravenscroft that very morning.
I don't think you ought to say nasty things of that sort, Aunt Church, for if you do I may be able to--" Aunt Church fixed her glittering black eyes on Susan.
Now, quite the nearest way to the railway station was across the common.
"And what occupies you, love, at all at all?" said Miss O'Flynn as she ate her second oyster-patty.
"What are young legs for if not to wait on old legs?
Her father was rich, and he did not mind what he spent on his only child.
We want to have the meeting at your aunt's.
"I shall get used to it," replied Ruth.
"You are sure you wouldn't rather wait in the house?" "No, really.
"I want to have a beautiful, nice tea.
She was an excellent woman of business, and was dreaded not only by the schoolgirls, but also by one or two of the ladies of the committee; those who most feared her were the two Misses Scott and Miss Jane Smyth.
David came up to her at once; he was the favorite, and people said he had a way with him.
There was no answer for a minute; then Tom appeared, looking somewhat rakish and disheveled.
She is sitting in the drawing-room.
You annoyed me very much indeed.
I don't know what you have done to vex her." "But I do," said Ruth.
I believe, in short, that she is the typical sort of girl of whom the founders thought when they instituted this great and noble house of learning.
The difficulty is that we have got to keep the thing from the knowledge of the teachers and the paying girls of the school.
"Have you really decided, Ruth?" she said.
I can't abide finding myself on the salty sea.
Anyhow, here is a note for you.
Do you think I want all these things for myself?" "I am sure you don't, dear." "It quite makes me ache with longing to give some of them away.
"We must let her have her own way.
Ruth's little face, however, remained perfectly white and still; only her eyes were dark with emotion.
She clasped her grandfather's hand firmly.
You are a very naughty, rebellious girl.
Some boys at the opposite side of the street saw her and burst out laughing.
They were usually a good deal tormented by the foundationers, who took their revenge by small spiteful ways--by taking the ink when they did not want it, by removing good pens and putting bad ones in their places, by spilling ink on the blotting paper.
"There are eight of us here, and we all swear allegiance to you.--Don't we, girls?" "Certainly," said Susy.
I am as wild and naughty and----Oh, but don't let us talk about me.
There will be something nice for you when you come back to tea," said Kathleen.
She had to count every penny, and, above all things, to avoid going in debt.
Kathleen jumped up, shut the window, and fastened it.
There are others who would look at the thing from a different point of view, but I don't think I envy those others.
Alice had always been a little difficult; she was more than difficult at the present moment.
The Governors of the School Examine Ruth 242 XXI.
You think you have, but you haven't.
It is never safe to leave money about." "But I haven't got the money, Aunt Church.
She now removed her mittens, put a napkin on her lap, and bent forward with a look of appetite to regard the different dishes which Ellen, the tiny twelve-year-old servant, brought in.
"I could fly out at her," thought the old lady; "but where's the good?
Craven was seated by the fire.
"As to the chivalrous nature of your silence, I fail to see it.
those things ought to be counted in the education of a woman.
I shall be sorry I asked you to come with me if you look any graver." "But you make me feel grave, Kathleen," said Ruth.
"It won't take me long to say what I want to say." She linked her hand in her companion's as she spoke.
Occasionally people turned to glance at the trio--the grave, refined, extremely pretty, but shabbily dressed girl; the radiant child, and the vivacious little lady who might be her mother but who scarcely looked as if she was.
Church was a little woman; she had very tiny feet and hands, and was very proud of them.
Kate rushed up to her.
But the teacher on this occasion did not complain of Susy; there were so many other things to be considered that she thought she would let the matter pass.
"If," continued Miss Mackenzie, interrupting Mrs.
Church with her ablutions, she produced a clean cap and a little black shawl.
She's terribly unhappy, and she will be certain sure to pay you next week.
Then the omnibuses they were to go on, the seats at the theatre, their supper of some sort must be paid for by the head of the society.
"I don't think that is a very fair rule," she said.
I saw a man going by not ten minutes ago, and he looked suspiciously at the house.
there never, never was anything made so beautifully before.
It was only half-past seven.
"The dear child is frightened, Miss Mackenzie," said Mrs.
THE WILD IRISH GIRLS' SOCIETY IS STARTED.
I'm afraid that must be put a stop to," said the old lady.
"I will think it over and let you know," said Ruth.
How can I take her part?" "You can say--oh, the kindest things.
"We have had old Irishwomen overworked like that, and all of a sudden they went out like snuffs: that is what happens.
As she passed Ruth she put her hand on her shoulder and said in her most pleasant voice: "Extraordinary thing; Miss Ravenscroft has sent for me.
It was so kind of you to come to see us this afternoon.
She belonged to us for a time, and now she doesn't belong to us." "Well?" said Kathleen, feeling interested and a little startled.
I never looked for it that he would die in the foreign parts and leave you to your grandmother and me.
Now I want a good bit of money; not a pound or even five pounds, but more than that.
Why, the lady who has charge of you." "Mrs.
The girls who are rebellious in the school must be exposed; their conduct must be investigated, and a very heavy punishment awarded to them." Here Miss Ravenscroft looked round her.
I should like to know." "Then I will tell you," said Alice.
Mother and the boys are fairly mad on Kathleen; and as to the servants, there's nothing they wouldn't do for her.
"I quite understand your being lonely.
She put a little kettle on the gas-stove, fetched a clean cup and saucer, and presently sat down to her belated meal.
She might even have cried." Kathleen raised her brows as she said the last word; her face expressed consternation and a trifle of amazement.
She was naturally vain and frivolous, except in the presence of her dearest friend.
Meanwhile that young lady, having arranged a bolster in her bed to look as like a human being as possible, put on her hat and jacket and ran downstairs.
"She is the most awful girl I ever heard of.
They're trying to find out all about poor Kathleen's society, in order to put a stop to it and to call the foundationers to order; but the only effect of the fuss is to make more and more of the girls want to join.
Indeed, I'm glad I'm not made on Alice's pattern, even if she is your daughter.
She went so far as to beg and implore of Kathleen, but Kathleen was imperturbable.
"She thinks that we are just as good as herself.
I declare I won't go if it is as bad as that." "It would be like you not to come," said Alice.
Dinner was announced, and the three went into the great dining-room.
"Will you come to the drawing-room, young ladies?" He conducted the children down some wide passages covered with thick Turkey carpets, opened the folding doors of a great drawing-room, and left them to themselves.
Come with me, Susy." There were about forty girls in the yard, and they sat close together.
I shall be awfully polite and sweet to dear Alice.
I should like if possible to have all the foundation girls on my side, but that must be decided at our next meeting.
"Yes, granddad; coming in a moment or two," Ruth replied.
You must let me come up with you." But Kathleen made no answer.
She did not care so much for beauty as for style; she made style her idol.
I can't imagine what has happened to her." Mrs.
You will be fond of me, won't you?" "I like you now," said Ruth.
They were both to work for two hours, and afterwards their coach was to arrive.
Supper was served, and was eaten with considerable relish by all three.
O'Hara took Miss O'Flynn's hint very much to heart.
Susy Hopkins shared none of Ruth Craven's scruples.
Tennant did her good, and she went upstairs to dress for supper in a happier frame of mind.
She said that a polite lie was an awful sin, so in this house I must cleave to the home truths.
She was sorry for her own sake that she had met Kathleen, and that she was going with her to London; but on the other hand she was glad that she was with the girl, who by herself might have got into a serious scrape.
She's got plenty to think about.--Won't you turn him out now, Aunt Church?
She tried to believe that she was enjoying herself and was having a right good time.
I declare that girl is causing me to hate my home.
Poor women came in for penn'orths of paper.
Hopkins was also standing just outside the shop, putting a wrap round the old lady and tucking her up.
If they have talent they have every chance of bringing it to the fore, for the education is thorough and generous.
She was in good time.
In an age when girls were almost uneducated, when nothing further was required from them than a smattering of reading and writing, these wise and far-seeing people said that they would give the girls of the future a chance.
A large bottle of crystalline oil accompanied the lamps.
She then went on to attend to other duties.
The next morning, quite early, Kathleen was up.
I tell you what it is, Susy.
I take a great--- very great--interest in Ruth, Miss Ravenscroft.
"But why is the whole school in the central hall?" asked Kathleen.
It was now half-past eight, and Susy determined to take the bull by the horns and to close the shop without further ado.
Kathleen was nowhere to be seen.
It was founded some hundred years ago, by those who thought much and in advance of their time.
Hold this while I--Why, sakes alive, Susy!
She put on the first head-dress which came to hand, buttoned a rough, shabby-looking jacket over her velvet dress, snatched up her purse which lay in a drawer, and without waiting for either gloves or necktie, ran downstairs and out of the house.
There was a disconcerting pause, and then Kathleen said: "Hannah, doubtless you are right.
But we weren't proud afterwards when we heard that he was killed.
You have chosen, from what false motives it is impossible to say--" "My dear," interrupted Mrs.
Tears trembled in her bright black eyes, and she turned her head to one side.
When she left the head-mistress's presence she felt a certain sense almost of elation.
I think you will have to put up with a rather serious conversation with her this morning.
"I can't make out what has put it into his head.
"She will catch cold and be ill; that will be the next trouble," thought the indignant Alice.
Michael--" The girl's face slightly changed.
I never saw such a worn-out poor body.
"You always have a joke among you three, and I want to share it.
I don't see what call you have to be going anywhere else on Sunday evening." "I want to see Ruth Craven.
"I know the shop quite well." Susy said good-bye, and then stepped down the little path.
Kathleen O'Hara would have died long ago but for her friends.
"Don't you like the sky when it looks as it does now?
"I did think you'd sit quietly with me and learn your collect.
TOM HOPKINS AND HIS WAY WITH AUNT CHURCH.
"I can't be two things," she said to herself.
"Come home with me, won't you?" Ruth did not speak.
Still, by working hard morning, noon, and night--she added to her gains by doing fine needlework for several ladies, who said that no one could embroider like Mrs.
Now you are dressed; that's fine.
You were a member of that rebellious society, the Wild Irish Girls?" "Yes, Miss Mackenzie." Ruth's "Yes" was very clear; her face looked modest but firm.
"But I don't see the chaperone," he remarked.
"Hush!" she said, putting her finger to her lips; "he is asleep." "I have brought Kathleen O'Hara, granny.
"Don't--don't keep me," she said.
It doesn't matter that I should know more, does it?" "I can't agree with you.
"What a time you have been, child!" she said.
"Isn't it true that you are one of the Shirley scholars now?" "I am; I joined the school to-day." "And yet you come to fetch beer for your old grandfather!" "I do," said Ruth, with spirit.
Why should you speak to me in that reproving voice?" "It isn't that; only they were like two angels.
In that case it would be a matter of insurrection on your part, and it is very doubtful if you would be allowed to remain in the school." "It is very cruel to me," began Ruth.
"I have a slight cold, and the draught will make it worse." "Why, then, of course, darling," said Kathleen in a hearty voice, as she brought down the window with a bang.
"If the worst--the very worst--comes," she said to Susy, "we can sell them; but I cling to them as a piece of respectability that I never want to part from.
If she had a good balance and all things nicely squared up, we'd have a nice little joint for Sunday; and she'd put on her little bonnet and best mantle, and we'd go for a walk in the country arm-in-arm, just like the Darby and Joan we were, Ruthie, and which we are.
Susy turned on Ruth as though she would like to eat her.
It doesn't matter to me.
This was decidedly more difficult than her downward one; but she was light of foot and agile.
My aunt Katie O'Flynn--she's the finest figure of a woman you ever laid eyes on--thought that I ought to have learning; mother thought so too, but the dad didn't much care.
Mary Addersley and Rhoda Pierpont are to call for me shortly, and I shan't be ready.
You ought to be more respectful." "Arrah, then, darling, I can't; 'tain't in me.
When Kathleen had gone upstairs, Mrs.
There must not be friendship--not real friendship, I mean--between us and them." "You are a paying girl yourself," suddenly exclaimed Mary Rand.
Kathleen, as years went on, became far and away the most popular girl in the school.
You know, although you pretend not to feel it, but you all must know how we foundationers are sat upon and objected to in the school.
It has pleased the Almighty, Susan, to put you in a low walk of life, and in that walk you ought to remain, and dress according--yes, dress according.
Mother would be wild if she had to sit up so late." Ruth was silent.
She learned to be a thief, and she broke her mother's heart, and she was locked up in prison.
"I never saw any one quite so lovely before as the queen," said Mary Rand.
I think it is on account of the day." They had now reached the little path which led up to the cottage.
She snuggled close up to Kate and slipped her hand through her arm.
She returned to her darning and her anxious thoughts.
And me to be out of my money that I counted upon.
I hope you will be very quick, for I am rather sleepy and intend to go to bed soon." "I hope you won't do it again, that's all." "Do what again?" asked Kathleen.
She had a crimson sash round her black velvet dress, and a wide lace collar encircled her neck.
"Oh, dear!" cried Alice, "there are those dreadful boys again.
Her mother certainly required if ever a mother did require a daughter.
I don't blame your daughter Susan for going out with that nice young lady.
I don't want your tea.
If there are only six, why shouldn't we have jolly seats somewhere, and not waste our time outside the theater?" "That would be nice," said Kate Rourke.
She was homesick in the most intense sense of the word.
Who minds what a slip of a young lady says?--meaning no offence to you, miss; but I have been spending my money right and left, getting tea that beats all for gentility, and now one of the ladies is off as it were in a flash of an eye.
Hopkins was on her way home after doing a little shopping on her own account.
Tennant, "and have your tea.
The blouse had real lace round the neck and cuffs, and must have cost a great deal of money.
"I meant to pay for forty.
"How careless of me not to have shut it!" she thought.
The tea would have to be drunk without milk, and with only a modicum of brown sugar, for Mrs.
Cassandra Weldon is my friend, and there are others.
"I am a coward, and I ought to be ashamed of myself," she thought.
"It can't be done," she thought.
Ruth is the kind who never tells.
We know what it means, of course." "You look very mysterious," said Kathleen.
Tom was very attentive to Mrs.
She provided the woman with a stamp, and then, shut the drawer of the till.
And as to Alice, she'd be even worse.
I know all about you, and I want to know you better.
"I do wish you would speak out.--Do get her to speak out, Mrs.
"I wish you wouldn't do that, Susy," said her mother.
You won't hate me forever, will you?" Alice growled something in reply.
I couldn't live if I wasn't really naughty sometimes.
Afraid!--Don't keep me, good people," said Kathleen.
Evening after evening she would question her daughter eagerly with regard to this accomplishment and the other, to this change or that, to this chance which Cassandra might have and to the other.
Kathleen gave her a quick glance.
David, if you give me a letter I'll--I'll love you ever so much.
"If I could only double, hide for a minute, and make her give up the chase, all would be well," thought the mischievous Irish girl.
"Oh, it's that stupid, tiresome Ruth Craven," answered Hannah.
They save them, of course.
It doesn't matter a bit about my being late for dinner at the Tennants'.
It was all delightful, this stealing away in the dark, this pressing one against another as they walked down the little road.
She stood very upright, and looked full at Cassandra.
Hopkins kept hers open until nine o'clock.
And we will put out the best tea-things, and a clean cloth; and it will rest the poor tired one so tremendously when she comes in and sees a good meal on the table." Both cook and Maria were quite excited.
When she got into the passage she hummed a little air.
Go in quickly; you may be in time, after all." The voice of the monitress quite shook, and there was a troubled, very nearly tearful expression in her eyes.
"So your are not learning much?" "I am getting on with my music.
I have come from my dear mountain home to be civilised; but civilisation will never suit Kathleen O'Hara.
"No fear now that I shall not have plenty of excitement in the coming by-and-by.
She was a very fresh foundation girl, and recognized something in Kathleen which caused her to be more subservient than was necessary.
"Why, of course I'll come, heart of my life.
This door was never opened except to the head-mistress and her visitors.
"Oh, that's very likely, darling," said Kathleen; "but I don't think I much care.
Well, all right, I'm ready." She pushed her fingers through her tangled golden hair, and, without glancing at herself in the glass, marched out of the room.
She looked, as usual, bright and capable.
They assembled in the committee-room, and I was present.
if mother can apprentice him to somebody, that is the most that can be expected.
We can do some good work." "Let us," said Ruth.
He could not see the parlor beyond, nor the peep-hole where Susy was supposed to be able to watch the shop; he only noticed that no one was within.
She is a great help to her mother.--Mary Hopkins, come nigh, dear.
and was waked not a fortnight ago.
Your mother is tired, and you--you lazy omadhauns--" "Well, go on," said Ben.
I am going to town afterwards." Without waiting for Susy's reply, Kathleen turned on her heel and returned home.
"You make me laugh whenever I look at you," was Kathleen's next candid remark.
"Pink is more Alice's color.
I wish you would." "I can't tell you, Susan; it has nothing to do with you.
"Here's a cargo for you," she said.
"Don't you think Alice would look very nice in one of these?" said Kathleen, gazing with a very earnest face at Mrs.
She looked down, so that the fun in her eyes could not be seen.
"They'd soon put a stop to it." "Are you certain?
"I did what I was made to do.
But, notwithstanding the hat and the dress, there was the face.
Presently she thrust out a moist little hand, and out of the moisture produced a half-melted peppermint drop.
She soon reached her destination, walked up the little path which led to the tiny cottage, and tapped with her fingers on the door.
Tell them that I am game for a real bit of fun, and that I will stand treat.
When Kathleen appeared all was immediately changed.
"I don't think I can ever change my way," she said.
Kathleen took up the first book she could find and pretended to read.
It is therefore my painful duty to call upon Miss Ravenscroft as head-mistress to expel you, Ruth Craven, from this school.
We gave you three days to consider, telling you that if at the end of that time you still kept to your resolution there was only one thing for us to do, and that was to make an example of you in the presence of the entire school--in short, to take from you your right of membership, and to expel you from the school, taking from you all privileges, all chances of acquiring learning and the different valuable scholarships which this school was opening to you.
For the life of you don't let _her_ see it; she'd never forgive me.
You have never been at school before, and of course you find it irksome." "Is it irksome?" cried Kathleen.
In the passage a monitress was standing, and when she saw Kathleen she came up to her and said in an agitated tone: "They are all assembled in the great hall.
She seems to be displeasing some of those in authority." "Kathleen had a note too, asking her to call." "Then it must be about her.
What a pity we can't know her!" said Alice Tennant.
It's a very bobbish little kettle, and it has cranky whims just as though it were a human.
Church shook her head at the apparition, but for a time no one noticed the circumstance.
They are all coming, up to forty of them in number, and Miss Kathleen O'Hara is the queen amongst them.
You can go to that horrible, detestable girl when it is necessary, and have your odious coach to post you up.
The box seemed to fill up every crevice of her heart, as she expressed it, and it was a very happy girl who dressed to go to the Weldons' that evening.
"You will be so set up now, Susan Hopkins, that we won't be able to bear you in the same class," said Clara Sawyer.
I can't in justice to her explain any further, Florence.
Oh, yes, they were having a glorious time; and it was quite right to do what you liked sometimes, and quite right to defy your elders.
We bear it as meekly as we can for the sake of our so-called advantages; but if we can be snubbed, we are, and if we can be neglected, we are--although it isn't the teachers we have to complain of, but the girls.
Craven?" "Oh, my dear young lady, but we live so plain!" "And so do I when I am at home," said Kathleen.
There was a special class which she was anxious not to miss, for in spite of herself she was becoming interested in certain portions of her lessons.
Of all the girls in the school whom you, Miss O'Hara, have tried to injure, you have selected the foundationers, who have only been to Board schools before they came here.
Her rude words, the impertinent little toss of her head, and the defiant glance out of her very dark-blue eyes caused Cassandra to stamp her foot.
She pushed it out of sight on the shelf, and sat down again to her book.
"An hour and a quarter before the meeting of the Wild Irish Girls," she said to herself.
Church began to recollect herself.
It's a very great honor for an old lady to be entertained to her tea in a castle.
Ruth Craven has only just joined.
Parkins says he will trust me for quite a month; but however I am to pay your Aunt Church, and keep enough money for the new goods, beats me.
David was very musical; indeed, the soul of music dwelt in his eyes, in his voice, in his very step.
She was a very beautiful girl, and she was warm-hearted and amiable.
Her father, Squire O'Hara, was, as landlords in Ireland go, very well off.
She heard Alice's step, and she felt a certain vindictiveness as she turned the key in the lock.
She was just arriving at the station when she saw Ruth Craven coming to meet her.
Tennant," shouted Kathleen, "I have the top of the morning as far as news is concerned.
I will sit in the tired one's chair, and you can sit on that little stool at my feet.
If you are a good boy, and do me credit, and get on with your books, and do well in that calling which Providence means you to work in, why, I may leave it to you when I am called hence, Tom." "There, Tom!" said Susy, coming forward.
She nodded her head twice and said: "Thank you, dear," and just then Susy returned, and tea began in real earnest.
Nobody wants to be hard on you; nobody wants to be hard on your founder, although she must no longer take her place as a member of this school; but if you don't confess, very stringent and terrible methods will have to be resorted to." Miss Ravenscroft here resumed her seat.
_The Rebel of the School_ BY MRS.
Let her in at once, my dear." "I am very sorry, darling Mrs.
Alice went out to her.
Ruth, do you know where it is?" "I haven't the most remote idea." "Oh, well, we'll get there somehow.
Most elegant damask on the table.
Now then, here is the box.
Ruth was walking slowly by with her usual demure and sweet expression.
"Surely you must know that for yourself.
The Queen and Her Secret Society 79 VIII.
I did not suppose one was to be found in this horrid part of the world.
He will borrow a wheelbarrow, and all the things can be stacked away tidily into it, and he will take them straight off to Aunt Church's house with you immediately after dinner.
She looked rather nice; she wore a very pretty pink muslin blouse, which suited her well.
Don't let me feel that I have spoilt her life." "But why did you act so, Kathleen O'Hara?" said Miss Mackenzie.
Over some of the girls of the Great Shirley School there passed that morning a curious wave of excitement.
You dare not fail me now," said Kathleen, with enthusiasm.
I know a way in which you can secure my good opinion." "Really!" said Kathleen, who was too angry now to be properly polite.
"Ruth Craven hasn't come yet," said another voice.
"Do you want my grandchild?" she said, observing Susy's size and dress.
The Irish girl was nowhere in sight.
She oughtn't to go into an almshouse if she is rich," said Susy.
The day was a very cold one, and the fire was by no means bright.
I have it in the bottom of my trunk.
But beyond the mere beauty of feature Kathleen had to a remarkable degree the far more fascinating beauty of expression: her face was capable of almost every shade of emotion, being sorrowful and pathetic one moment, and brimful of irrepressible mirth and roguery the next.
"Perhaps you don't like it." "I can't say I do." "Well, this is the Palace of Home Truths," said Kathleen, laughing.
I like you very much, Ruth, but you really need not interfere with me." "I should think not indeed," said Miss O'Flynn.
You must have nothing more to do with it." Kathleen slightly shook her head.
I must be back at school by half-past two.
There was a silence amongst the girls until Mary Rand shouted: "Hip!
that is the way of Irish hearts.
Alice's ways are not my ways, and if I copied her it's kilt I'd be entirely.
Now the only girl not a member of the society who can give those particulars is the girl I have been talking about; for, of course, she knows, as she belonged to it at one time although she has now left it.
Here's a sovereign, which will more than cover the expenses of the tea.--Good-bye, Kathleen, core of my heart.--Good-bye, all of you." Miss O'Flynn flung a sovereign on the table.
Church; "can't pay me to-day!
No, no, daddy, your Kathleen will be your Kathleen to the end--always loving, always daring, always true, but always rebellious; the best and the worst.
Her face looked sunshiny and genial.
"Are you awfully tired, Ruth Craven?" she said.
"It's Aunt Church, and she's dreadful." "An old lady?" cried Kathleen.
Amongst the many girls who attended the Great Shirley School was one who was known by the name of Cassandra Weldon.
Naylor said: "Very pretty; quite touching, isn't it?
In appearance Cassandra was a tall, well-made girl, graceful in her movements, and very self-possessed in manner.
The following day dawned bright and clear, with a suspicion of frost in the air.
I'm not certain that I take to her at all.
If you will give me the latchkey I can let myself in.
We could have our meetings there--I know we could--and she'd never tell.
Nothing ever induced Alice to neglect her studies, for did not the scholarship depend on her doing her very utmost?
The moment her voice penetrated to Kathleen's ears, she jumped to her feet, crossed the room, and bent down at the other side of the keyhole.
Church glanced over her shoulder and looked solemnly at Susy.
They are under the supposition that there never were such fine ladies to be found in the land before.
I will stay for a bit and see what I can make of the foundation girls." "The foundation girls?" "Oh, yes; don't ask me to explain.
I shall be happy when I have got a creelful of them here.
Now, Kathleen tried to bear with Mrs.
"Whisper," he said in her ear.
"Why, grandfather, what is the matter?" said Ruth in some surprise.
Her cheeks were hot, her hair in disorder, and her hand, where she had touched the peppermint, was sticky." "What would father say if he could see me now?" she thought.
It was very unfortunate my lending that money." "What money?" "Oh, I will tell you another time; it doesn't really matter.
I have brought you a little bag that I made my own self, and you shall have it if you promise me something.
But she has written me such a queer letter, and implored and besought of me not to come to see her, that I am forced to accede to her wishes.
I adore beauty; I worship it more than anything else on earth.
"I am bad, but I have my own principles--and a good old-fashioned set, worth a great deal." She nodded impertinently to both the girls, and then reentered the school.
I quite like the child myself," said Miss Ravenscroft; "and your opinion of her, Cassie, confirms my own.
It is an awful pity to have gone to the expense of coming here if you don't mean to do your utmost." "Thank you, darling, but it is rather a waste of breath for you to talk so long to me.
"Do you know my daughter?" she asked.
Always pale, she looked a little paler now than her wont.
Two of the mistresses spoke to me about you to-day.
I wish I might drive that horse instead of the stupid old Jehu on the box.
She went there at once, wondering if the head-mistress wanted to give her particular instructions with regard to the great scholarship examination which would take place at the end of the term.
She wants to bring, not the long arm of the law, but father's arm right across the sea to stop me.
"You'll catch it," said Alice.
Your mother was a governess, but she was a lady by birth; her father was a clergyman.
So I thought, 'My time has come.
Her darks eyes seemed to darken and grow full of intense emotion; otherwise no one could have told that she was suffering or feeling anything in particular.
I made up my mind when I drew that hundred pounds from my dear husband's hard-earned savings that, whatever happened, I'd make that sum last me for all expenses for three years.
It was now seven, and the girls were to call for Alice at half-past.
You, of course, must please yourself." "My dear child, leave it to me," said Miss O'Flynn.
"Doesn't it break your heart to see him?" "Oh no," said Ruth.
I expect I shall have great fun with them.
far be it from me to be impatient; I wouldn't be for all the world.
She tossed her head and walked away.
Don't you see that I am reading?" "I want you to stop reading.
The driver was directed to take them to the Métropole, and they started off.
What have I done?" "Ah, miss!
She is so nice, and so is her mother.
I just want us to have a bit of fun, and to teach the horrid paying girls of the school a lesson." The thought of her secret society kept Kathleen in a fairly good humor, and she worked at her lessons so well that Alice began to have hopes of her.
"A little tin of sardines--some ladies are fond of a savory--" "Yes, mother; quite right.
"I am sure from your face that you will not tell me a lie." "No," said Kathleen, "I won't tell you a lie." "I must, however, ask you one or two direct questions.
she's the daughter of Mrs.
And she is so splendid to look at, and has such a gallant sort of way.
Your Kathleen wouldn't hurt a fly, much less your heart.
Susy went to church with her mother in the morning, the dinner being all prepared and left to cook itself in the oven.
"I can get you some things at the railway station; you ought not to wait for supper in town," said the gentleman in a stern voice.
"Mother," she said, "I am obliged to be out the whole afternoon.
Good-bye now; I must go in and kiss my darling Ruth." Susy Hopkins stood for a minute to watch Kathleen as she went up the little narrow path of Sans Souci.
"You couldn't expect us not to have a bit of meat on Sunday," said Tom.
David took her hand and led her into the dining-room.
She's a splendid girl; and, to tell you the honest truth, none of you are fit for her to touch you with a pair of tongs." "Dear, dear!" said Susy.
SUSY HOPKINS PERSUADES AUNT CHURCH.
I could beat you, every one of you, and the teachers, too, in some accomplishments.
"You will forgive me, dear," she said; "I am a mother and have daughters of my own.
On the contrary, you and I will go together to see Aunt Katie O'Flynn.
Even if the old man can't square up the ledger, Ruth is as right as right can be.
We are at present in a very unpleasant position in the school.
I like to see girls nicely dressed.
She's meant to dance on the tops of the mountains, and to gather flowers in the bogs.
How can you stand music then?
"She thinks, I suppose," said Kathleen, "that she'll subdue me by these means.
Alice can teach you; she can help you very much.
If you don't like it all at all, it's home you will come with me to the old castle and the old country.
It had lived through its greatest and most exciting hour.
I can't do it always, but I will on this occasion.
Tennant's motherly care and for Kathleen's board and lodging.
"We will then know what she wants, and if there is anything in it.
"No," answered her mother; then catching sight of the teapot, she added, "You might have had the tea-things removed, Susy.
But you are the one my heart has gone out to.
Her heart was full; she felt depressed.
She put on crimson silk stockings, and tucked into her bag a pair of crimson satin shoes.
She was sorry to give it up, but it seemed to her that it was the only right and honorable thing to do.
I invited her to have tea with us to-morrow, and she is coming." "My word!" said Tom.
Fussing over fine living, I suppose.
But I could do a kindness to you and your mother if--if certain things were to come to pass.
I should like to be kind to you, Miss O'Hara.
"I'm awfully obliged to you, Ben.
"You all see Ruth Craven," continued Miss Mackenzie.
There was a time when I'd have liked it well, but not now.
Kathleen was consulted, and of course tabooed the entire scheme; in the end, however, the elder ladies carried the day.
Then expel me and my companions; turn us out of the school, but keep the girl who would be a credit to you." CHAPTER XXIX.
Her hair, very light in colour, hung down her back.
"She came up to me just now and asked me to join her and some other girls at the back of the Laboratory.
I have a picture of my father upstairs; it is taken with his uniform on.
Poor Alice wants to get in to get her clothes.
"We must meet again in a couple of days," said Kathleen finally.
She first of all drew the bolt to secure herself against intrusion, and then stepping on tiptoe, she unlocked a drawer and took from it several ends of candle which she had collected from time to time.
It was just before she was fifteen that Kathleen's aunt, a maiden lady from Dublin, who rejoiced in the truly Irish name of O'Flynn, came to see them, remarked on Kathleen's wild, unkempt appearance, declared that the girl would be a downright beauty when she was eighteen, said that no one would tolerate such a want of knowledge in the present day, and advised that she should go to school.
Ruth, darling, you don't know how pretty you look; and even though you have deserted me, and won't join my darling, beloved society, yet I shall always love you." Here Kathleen seated herself near Ruth and flung one arm around her waist.
She had made up her mind.
I should not like to see girls in the position you are in without offering to help them." "But what do you mean?" said Kathleen.
Some of the visitors left rather important messages, but Kathleen did not remember them for more than a moment after they were delivered.
Ah, and isn't that one a beauty?" "Hush, Kathleen--do hush!" said Alice.
On the contrary, she loves you very much; and she will take Miss Ruth Craven back with her.
Miss Jane Smyth murmured the words "Wild Irish Girls" under her breath.
"My name is Kathleen O'Hara.
They fear that during this term you may be forced to continue in your present low position; but they earnestly hope that you will work very hard, so as to be removed into a higher form.
Her father is very rich, and he keeps dogs and horses and carriages and--oh, everything that rich people keep.
"I wonder why you talk like that.
I hate her like poison." "That is very wrong of you, Susy.
So the head-mistress had written; she had dared to write to Kathleen's father.
"She has not chosen to appear, and I wish to take quick and instant steps.
These ladies have come to meet you, because they wish thoroughly to investigate a most disgraceful matter which has lately been going on in the school." Miss Ravenscroft paused and looked round her.
Kathleen awoke on the special morning after a night of wild dreams.
"This is a nice state of things, I must say.
She plays beautifully, and they will sing." "Irish songs?" called out Kathleen.
Alice's face was still full of an awful suppressed knowledge, which she would not let out to any one; but Mrs.
Church that it is absolutely quite certain that she will get it.
There was nothing for it but to take out his big and not too clean handkerchief and wipe her tears away.
She would be seventeen on her next birthday, and it was against the rules for any girl to remain at the Great Shirley School after that time.
I want to go and see Aunt Church." "Why should you do that, child?
There was no one in the hall, and she was absolutely daring enough to go out by that door.
The desire to go to the town on a message for her mother had completely left her.
Church, "and there's a measuring spoon close to it.
"What is your name?" she asked.
We are all pleased, and expect that she will be a very great acquisition." "Irish girls always are," said Mary.
"It isn't only that she's lovely, she is so genteel," said Susy Hopkins.
"It doesn't sound right, does it?" "Right or wrong, it is fun," said Kathleen.
I can't understand who could have stolen the money.
She must get me out of this scrape.
"Look round, Susan Hopkins, and ask me what I am to do!
They were Susy Hopkins, Kate Rourke, Clara Sawyer, Rosy Myers, Janey Ford, and Mary Wilkins.
"Oh, yes, you will, Ruth.
Her grandmother was waiting for her in the porch.
You will--you must--change your mind.
She didn't much like it, but here she is; and she's on tenter-hooks to get home, so she can return with you, can't she?" "You must come too, Kathleen.
There were swings and garden-seats and preparations for tennis and other games in the rest of the big playground, but nothing had ever been done at the back of the Laboratory.
"Oh, Susy," she said, "I am so glad you have come!
The next morning Cassandra Weldon was much surprised, on arriving at the school, to receive a message asking her to step into Miss Ravenscroft's special sanctum.
Kathleen looked at him attentively.
"What meddlesome people!" "Don't!" said Kathleen.
I am not fond of those watery stews.
"What are you doing outside, Miss O'Hara?
She caught the eye of Miss Mackenzie, who beckoned to her and whispered something in her ear.
We are going to tea to-night to Mrs.
Miss Ravenscroft was standing by her window.
WIT AND GENIUS: THE PLAN PROPOUNDED.
Ben got as far as the door.
She promised to help me with regard to David's future.
Even for me to live at home is almost more than they can compass.
"I was naughty to go out, and I am called back.
AFTER THE FUN COMES THE DELUGE Kathleen O'Hara's nature was of the kind that rises to the top of the mountains and sinks again to the lowest vales.
It was barely furnished, and had kamptulicon instead of a carpet on the floor.
She forgot the humble little house, the lack of rooms, and the workmanlike appearance of the whole place.
She is the sort of girl that everybody loves, and I am not one to admire a universal favorite.
By go doing you will save the school and yourself.
The work of the school began, and all the girls were busy.
A moment later she was standing before the head-mistress.
She read the following words: "DEAR MISS O'HARA,--I should be glad if you would come round to see me at six o'clock this evening.
There was just a moment's pause, and during that complete silence a dreadful rushing noise came into Kathleen O'Hara's head.
My principal object in starting this society is to put those horrid paying girls in their proper places.
It was already whispered in the school that their secret proceedings were becoming known.
"Did you ever suppose that I was anything else?
"There are a hundred of us, you know, in the school." "That is a great number.
But, mother, I do think Aunt Church would relish a pound of sausages.
You will be had up before them.
She could make the piano sob with her heart-rendering notes; and again she could bring forth music clear and fairy-like.
"We couldn't get many in here," she said.
Perhaps it is Sunday morning and you are off to church." "No, grandfather; it is Saturday morning--quite a different thing." "Well, my love, I am as pleased as Punch about that school.
What did you do to her?" "Well," said Kathleen, "I rather like old ladies, and she struck me as something picturesque." "She's a horrid old thing, and not a bit picturesque.
When the two girls arrived they found five other girls waiting for them.
People would think I had a gold locket.
There came a day in early autumn, shortly after the girls had reassembled after their summer vacation, when they streamed out of the building in groups of twenties and thirties and forties.
She is at the Hôtel Métropole.
My aunt from Ireland (Miss O'Flynn is her name--Miss Katie O'Flynn) was staying at the Métropole.
A girl of that sort--fascinating, handsome, dangerous--works havoc in a school." "Listen, Cassie," said Ruth suddenly.
I have got news for you, and very good news, too.
At one side of the house was a tiny conservatory full of bright flowers.
"Wouldn't you like some oyster-patties and some plumcake to munch while you are talking, deary?" "I shouldn't mind." "I'll ring and order them." A servant appeared.
"I am sorry to say, Miss Mackenzie, that I do.
Don't be cross with me.
Presently she looked at the clock.
You can take one of your lesson-books with you if you like.
That's what they say." "Who cares what they say?" said Kathleen.
Now within the last week he has been at it again, just as if 'twas yesterday." "He has an old account-book on the table now, granny," said Ruth.
We can form a committee, and get other girls to join by degrees.
Now you will see how smart I can be.
"That can be managed," said Miss O'Flynn.
wherever did you get--" "Oh, it's my new blouse, mother." "Your new what?" "What you see, mother--my new blouse.
She joined it for a bit, and she liked it--that is, on the whole--but afterwards a girl who had not joined the society and did not belong to the foundationers, one whom I am sorry to say the foundationers did not care for at all, offered a great kindness to this girl--a very special and tremendous kindness--and the girl in her own mind decided that she would be doing wrong not to accept it.
"She is a great deal more of a lady than you are." The girl flushed.
She suddenly put up her hand and caught Susy by the arm.
She meant to tell her mother frankly that it was a present from Miss Kathleen O'Hara, but Mrs.
Weldon's, and Ruth Craven is to be there.
What fun I shall have!
She sent for the little maid in the kitchen to put up the shutters, and in a minute or two the shop was in darkness and Susy was racing through the remainder of her lessons.
"You don't quite understand our manners in this country.
"Come along; we may as well know.
Do you greatly object to my sleeping during that time?" "No, cross patch," said Kathleen, turning angrily on her pillow.
She had a determined walk and a good carriage.
She had a face summat like yours, no way pretty, but what you'd call boastful and conceited; and she thought a sight of herself, and put on gay dress that she had no call to wear.
Alice went on her knees and peered through the keyhole: Kathleen was seated by her dressing-table, and there was a sound of the furious scratching of a pen quite audible.
"I have a headache," she replied.
I had joined the other foundationers as a member of Kathleen's society.
"You resemble your great-uncle, my husband," she said.
"Then of course you will be wise, Ruth.
But as she did so Kathleen herself came near and flung her arm round Ruth's neck.
I shall have to eat it myself, for I have no money to buy anything else.
Just before the end of the morning she took her first lesson in music.
You have chosen the unworthy course.
I only went into the parlor because I could not do my exercises in the shop.
And then, of course, we throw in a lot of extra things--the black velveteen dresses, and other garments of the same quality." "It must be a wonderful place to live in.
"No, indeed I won't," said Ben.
I was so looking forward to a nice little supper with Cassandra and the other girls!
Will you take this young lady under your wing?" "Didn't I say we were to be mates, dear?" said Kathleen O'Hara; and as they passed from the great hall, Kathleen's hand was still fondly linked on Ruth's arm.
I am so fond of you--oh, worra, worra!
She lit up the dullness and made a centre of attraction--all eyes were fastened upon her; for Kathleen in her well-made dress, notwithstanding the gayety of its color, looked simply radiant.
I wouldn't like to see that sort of sorry look in his dear dark-blue eyes.
She was a very kind woman herself; she was a motherly woman, too, and she thought of her own girls tucked up safely in bed at home, and wondered what she would feel if they were alone at a London theater at this hour.
I should love to make her look just as beautiful as she can look.
Tom has eaten his, and has gone to fetch the wheelbarrow from Dan Smith, the cartwright." Mrs.
Craven was seated by the fire.
Tennant and Miss O'Flynn were out.
The effect was somewhat the same as though a gorgeous butterfly had flown into the room.
"You have chosen such a funny place.
I should be sorry if she were expelled; there is so much that is good in her.
You have been so very, very kind to me.
I know that Alice Tennant has been questioned already.
Kathleen O'Hara darted from one group to another, smiled at one set of girls, patted the shoulder of a favorite girl in another group, laughed one time, said an emphatic word to another, and presently disappeared, accompanied by Susy Hopkins.
She kept thinking of her father.
Run into the shop the moment you have finished your tea, like a good child.
She flew as fast as she could the long way to the railway station.
I don't remember anything about her except that she was old and had wrinkles and a big picture-hat--the sort of hat that Ruth Craven would look pretty in." Mrs.
here you are," she said.
I had several severe losses.
But what's the matter, dear?" "Kathleen, I wish you wouldn't wear that really good dress going to school." "Is it my old lavender, and my old satin blouse?" said Kathleen, looking down at herself with a momentary glance.
She was standing in the wide courtyard waiting for the school doors to be opened.
"There is Ruth," she said, turning to Alice.
A minute or two later Alice left the house.
And see how it is made, with all these teeny tucks and the embroidery let in between.
"Well, if you are not in a hurry, why are you running across this field at the rate of a hunt?
"An extraordinary child," said Miss Mackenzie.
"Of course, there never was a boy like Tom.
She happens to be rich and beautiful, and to have a taking way; but all the others are not like her, I am certain of it." "Anyhow, whether they are or not, I am glad to belong to the society," said Susy.
You had better keep a sort of general eye on her, mother, for there's no saying what she will do.
There was a message for Kathleen to say that Miss O'Flynn expected her to be ready to go to town with her immediately after dinner.
That is what I came to say.
Hitherto she had been taught anyhow, but now she was all keen to receive real instruction.
And, oh, Susy, mum's the word with regard to me being well off.
"Is it that that every one is thinking about?" said Kathleen.
That I should live to see it!--Mary Hopkins, can it be convenient to you to let me have the remainder of my hundred pounds?
She is, with all her sweetness, very obstinate.
I wish it were different.
It takes, perhaps, a great deal of poverty to truly appreciate a new-laid egg.
"I know her," said Miss Mackenzie.
You won't tell, will you, Ruth?" Ruth made no reply in words.
MEADE AUTHOR OF "MISS NONENTITY," "THE SCHOOL FAVORITE," "MERRY GIRLS OF ENGLAND," "LITTLE MOTHER TO THE OTHERS," ETC.
In the whole of England I only love you, and you are going to give me up." "No; I will still be your friend." "But you have refused to join my society; you have refused to belong to the Wild Irish Girls." "I can't help myself." "But you promised." "I know I did.
Had she not climbed dangerous crags after young eaglets at home?
"Then what have you come for, Susan?" she said.
There never was a more splendid girl in all the world, but she requires to be known.
Suddenly she saw Ruth Craven going very quietly by.
You do wrong to conceal insurrection.
What is the matter?" "I must get home.
I don't think you ought to go on.
"I don't think even you will dare to defy the head-mistress.
She is the very, very pretty little granddaughter of old Mr.
"What are you going to do this afternoon?" said Alice, who was lying back in an easy-chair with an open novel in her hand.
You must go, and you must tell her." "Of course I'll go, mother," answered the boy.
Church forgot her anger in the interest that the boy's visit gave her.
Now do be quick; we will find the others before us.
"I am Alice Tennant," said the young girl, "and I have come at Miss Ravenscroft's request to see her." "Oh yes, miss, certainly.
Her cheeks were flaming with color, and her very dark-blue eyes looked as black as night.
Ross was a fashionable woman who went a good deal into London society, talked about the Great Shirley School to her different friends, and was considered an expert on the subject of girls' education.
It is from Miss Kathleen O'Hara, but that don't matter, either.
She could tell us all about them if she liked, and help us to bring the insurrection to an end." "Then that is capital," said Miss Mackenzie in a tone of enjoyment.
"You are very good," she said again.
Tennant began to find the remembrance of her delightful tea a little depressing, for, question Kathleen as she might, she did not remember anything about the ladies except a few fugitive descriptions.
In her heart of hearts she was very much distressed.
"It's the kind we always have at Myrtle Lodge," replied cook.
"Who is going to prevent me staying away from school if I wish to?" "The vote of the majority," said Alice very firmly.
Naughty Susy, having made up her mind to deny herself a new frock and new boots, had given the matter no further consideration.
His white locks fell about his shoulders; there was a faint touch of pink on each of his sallow cheeks, and his blue eyes were bright.
And yet you won't tell!" "It's because it's dishonorable to tell," said Ruth.
I told him you were here, and he would like to see you." "He has been bothered like anything about those accounts," said Mrs.
"At the beginning of the term," she said, "a girl of the name of Kathleen O'Hara joined our number.
"There are stables at the back of the house; they are old, worn-out stables.
Hopkins, with a groan; "but I haven't paid for one of them.
She got back into her chair, and motioned to Susy to take one opposite to her.
Are those young cousins of mine behaving themselves, the spalpeens?
She glanced with almost maliciousness at Alice, who, in the dowdiest of pale-gray dresses, with her hair rather untidy and her face destitute of color, was standing near one of the windows.
"You annoy me terribly by the way you go on." "Oh, don't be annoyed, darling," said Kathleen softly.
Put the books on this little table, and leave me for an hour or two.
"I am not going to have Aunt Katie so close to me without having my bit of fun.
I cannot stay long, but I will have a morsel of your grand dinner before I leave." CHAPTER XIII.
"I like people to wear smart clothes, don't you, Mrs.
Both men and women turned and stared at the children.
"Girls," she said, "it isn't at all certain that we are safe.
"I wasn't brought here to curry favor with them.
"But I am in a hurry.
"I have a great fancy for birds, and I am fond of new-laid eggs." "Fowls will do just as well," said Kathleen, rising now carelessly from her seat.
"We must get the ringleader into custody, so to speak, and either bind her over to break up the society, and so keep the peace, or expel her from the school." "She is a difficult girl to deal with," said Miss Ravenscroft.
I am sorry that Miss Ravenscroft expects her to go to see her to-day, as she is so devoted to her aunt and would enjoy seeing her." Mrs.
The piece which was presented on the boards happened to be a fairly good one.
Who can have come in and stolen very nearly a pound's worth of my hard-earned money?" "Nobody, mother dear.
"Never mind," said one of the ladies, kindly; "I will come in again next time I am passing.
To her dying day Kathleen never forgot that return journey.
That blouse is too smart for the coarse blue serge skirt you were wearing." "I know it is; but I can't afford a better skirt.
I have had my heart's desire, and because things are not quite so pleasant as I hoped they would have been, it is no reason why I should be discontented." The next moment she had lifted the latch at a small cottage and entered.
You will be sure to attend?
It's herself, of course." The knocker was just going to be applied to the door again, when Tom opened it with a flourish, and there stood, waiting on the steps, a very brilliant apparition.
Hopkins uttered a heavy sigh.
The idea of my being a servant.
I have been sent over to this country to learn.
Go for my sake," said Mrs.
It is on that ground they will expel you, but it is strong enough; no one can suppose for a moment that they are acting with injustice." "I am glad it is on that ground," said Ruth softly.
Alice was now obliged to go downstairs to acquaint her mother.
Miss O'Hara, you won't forget my poor aunt; you will be sure to get her the little almshouse in Ireland?" "Yes, of course I will," said Kathleen.
It might be dangerous to put off our glorious time till next week." "It might?
I can't stay in the room with her any longer; she is past bearing.
She fastened it; she put a belt round her waist.
Church, "of all the impertinent, bare-faced, wicked little girls, you beat them all.
"But I know what she is going through," thought Kathleen.
It was the custom of the governors to meet four times a year as a matter of course, and as a matter of expediency they met about as many times again.
To stick through thick and thin each to the other." "Yes!" cried every voice.
Tom turned first red and then white, and rushed into the passage.
Let me tuck my hand inside your arm, sweetest." A titter was heard from the surrounding girls.
"Do you think you will, miss?
I never knew that the cask was empty.
If you get Miss Renshaw's instruction you are safe to get that scholarship; and it is for three years, Ruth.
She's the prettiest, sweetest, bonniest thing I ever saw in my life.
I'm fairly taken with that microscope.
Miss Ravenscroft looked full at her.
I shall be able to support granny and grandfather.
And if you help in any sort of fashion, why, she'll take precious good care that you get into one of those little almshouses.
"Ruth is very pretty," said Susy to herself, "but I don't know that I quite admire her.
When Kathleen ran upstairs her heart was bubbling over with the first real fierce anger she had almost ever felt in her life.
"Come here, Miss O'Hara," said the voice of Miss Ravenscroft at that moment.
Your place in the school is secure enough." "What does that matter, Flo, when those you love are in danger?" "Those you love in danger, Cassie!
While Susy sat in the parlor a tramp happened to pass the brightly lighted shop.
I shall go off without anybody's noticing me." Kathleen had to take a great deal of money with her.
And where's the bread, and where's the butter, and all the rest of the breakfast?
They were to go in quite quietly by twos and twos; each couple of girls was to go to the booking-office and take their tickets, and walk away just as though nothing special had happened.
You make the promise first, faithfully and truly, and then I will tell you." After this there was a considerable wrangle between the old woman and the young girl, but all in good time Susy won her desire, and Mrs.
I was brought up in the midst of it.
"I suppose you couldn't shut up the shop and come with me, could you, mother?" "Shut up the shop!" said Mrs.
"Ah, Cassandra!" she said, "now you will be happy." "Yes; Ruth has accepted our offer." "Indeed I have, Mrs.
She had completely won their immature masculine hearts, and they invariably sat one on each side of her at meals, helped her to the best the table contained, and fussed over her in a way that pleased her young majesty.
Now my dear girls of the Great Shirley School, you must clearly understand that no establishment of this kind can be worked except on certain lines, and these lines mean order, method, and obedience.
But don't expel Ruth, and don't expel the others." "But we will all go if you are not kept," suddenly cried one of the sixty, Kathleen never quite knew which; and suddenly one girl after another began to speak up for her, and all promised that if Kathleen were allowed to remain, and if the whole story of the great rebellion was allowed to blow over, they would work as they had never done before.
Tennant, looking careworn and anxious, was seated at the head of the table; her dress was somewhat faded.
and upset the pig?" said Mrs.
I wonder what for." Ruth colored and looked down.
Only don't do it again, darling, for it is my place to give you tea, not yours to give it to me." CHAPTER VII.
Don't you admire it?" Mrs.
It means that in the presence of the whole school you are pronounced unworthy, that you leave the school publicly, being desired to do so by your teacher.
She took off her favorite blue velvet cap and pushed her hand through her masses of radiant hair, and then flung herself into what she was pleased to call an attitude, but which was really a very graceful and natural pose.
She rushed upstairs, but Kathleen was even quicker.
It was when the meal had come to an end that Kathleen said calmly: "Three or four, or perhaps five, ladies called while Maria was out." "Who were they, dear?" "I don't know.
There is no use in shirking things.
She had no time, however, to change her dress, but after washing her hands and smoothing out her tangled hair, and leaving Miss O'Flynn in the care of Mrs.
But you had better clearly understand, Susy, that if for any reason you are dismissed from the school there is nothing whatever for you but to take a place as a servant; and that you wouldn't like." "I should think not, indeed.
"The time is passing, and we must get to the bottom of Susy Hopkins's remarkable address.--What's up, Susy?
Mary Hopkins, where did you get that damask?" Mrs.
"Yes, darling, I'm trying to." "You mustn't use affectionate words in school." "Oh, my heart!
"I can't," she said; "it isn't my style.
I want to speak to you." Susy ran up to her in excitement.
She paused as if troubled by some thought; then her face grew bright, and she stepped along more briskly.
Her name was Rosy Myers.
We'll draw two chairs up to the fire and have a real collogue, that we will." "Yes, that we will," said Kathleen.
I know she is paying mother well for giving her a home while she is being educated at the Shirley School." "I can't imagine why she comes to our school if she is so rich," said Mary.
She was glad of the pain; it kept her from screaming aloud.
My answer to that, Susan Hopkins, is no; and you can leave the house, for that is the last word you will get." "Thank you, Aunt Church," said Susy.
"We ought to have meat--" she was beginning, when there came a bang and a scuffle, a girlish laugh, and Kathleen, leaning fondly on both the boys, appeared.
"I do hope this new school and the scholars and all this fuss and excitement of your new life won't turn your head.
"Yes, colleen, I mean it, for I want you to tell me all you can about your land of the shamrock." "Why, then, that I will," she replied.
She trod on air as she went down the street, and when she finally let herself into her mother's little shop, locked the door after her, and went softly upstairs, her heart was beating so loud that she hardly knew herself.
She rummaged about, making a great mess amongst her mother's neat stores; and finally she was obliged to say that she did not know where it was.
I declare I never felt so nervous in my life.--Do go back to the bedroom, Tom.--Aunt Church, oughtn't he to go?" "Come and sit by me," said Mrs.
You don't mean that _she's_ coming here?" "Yes; why not?
"She's the handsomest, most spirited, best little thing I ever met," thought the landlady of the "Lion," and she began to consider in her own mind if one of her men could not call round in the morning and leave the necessary beer at the Cravens'.
"Some one must have come into the shop, for the accounts are nineteen-and-sixpence short.
A little wonder and a little uneasiness came into her heart.
I suppose you have a certain sense of honor, and you don't want your father's money to be thrown away." "Bedad, then!
But one or two adored her, and amongst these was Florence Archer, a handsome, bright-faced, original sort of girl who was in the same form as Cassandra.
If that can be done, and you are successful in finding the girls, we shall have the matter, as it were, in a nutshell, and we shall soon crush this disgraceful rebellion." "And what about Kathleen?" asked Miss Ravenscroft.
Kathleen is in the highest spirits; she is just laughing and dancing about and looking like a sunbeam." "Dear, dear!" said Mrs.
It was the wish of the founders that there should always be one hundred foundationers on the school lists, and these girls are admitted free; they pay nothing in hard cash for what they receive.
Naylor, and speaking in a very firm tone--"if, instead of these pleasant things happening, a little girl learns to join insurrectionists, to forget those to whom she is indebted for such tremendous advantages, then how do matters stand--eh, Ruth Craven?" "I don't understand," said Ruth.
The diamond had been polished, and flashed brightly; the silver setting was also as good as was to be found.
Some of the girls went off into violent hysterics; others rushed out of the great hall, half-fainting; while others controlled themselves and listened as best they could.
"I know something better than that.
She is not coming." "Not coming?
She felt an uncomfortable sensation of being haunted by the faces of Ruth and the old man.
There was a minute or two of agonized terror on the part of Ruth, of suspense and rapid heart-beating as far as Kathleen was concerned, and then a deep, mellow, ringing voice was heard, and Miss Katie O'Flynn entered the apartment.
"Well, if you won't lay the cloth, and won't help your own poor old aunt, you may as well tell me what you came for." "Not yet.
She means to be very kind to you.
What is to be done?" Here Miss O'Flynn turned a face of anguish in Kathleen's direction.
Sides would be taken for and against her.
Tennant's advice with regard to her clothes in the week, but on Sundays she was absolutely determined that her love of finery should find full vent.
It is from Miss Ravenscroft, our head-mistress.
Susy knew far better than Kathleen what a mad action the girls were about to perpetrate.
They arrived in good time at their destination, and Mrs.
She's as unsuitable to be with you as she is to be with me.
Round her neck she wore innumerable beads of every possible color, and twisted through her lovely hair were some more beads, which shone as the light fell on them.
The unanimity and harmony of this entire large place is in danger, and the foundationers are in extreme peril.
Tennant found a tiny piece of paper pinned in conventional fashion to the pin-cushion.
I ask because I want to know," said Kathleen.
I am ever so sorry, Miss O'Hara." "You mean that you won't come when I have called for you?" "I am with Miss Weldon at present." "Be sensible, dear," said Mrs.
What are you putting on your best hat for?" "That is no affair of yours." "Oh, hoity-toity, how grand we are!
I must go upstairs now and fetch Kathleen.
I suppose I must have a tea, but it must be a very plain one." "No; it must be a very nice tea.
"The most extraordinary and the most lively nation on the face of the earth." The two vivacious Irishwomen entered their bedroom.
"The top of the morning to you, my honey!
I am more glad than sorry, on the whole, this morning.
Church was not enamored with the idea of keeping a pig.
I don't want Alice to know, because I dislike Alice very much." "Really, Kathleen, you ought not to speak like that." "Well, I do, and I can't help myself.
So Kathleen ate her breakfast with appetite, remarked on the brightness of the day to Mrs.
And she gave me this.
I saw her walking down the road with Cassandra Weldon." "And who is she?" "The head girl of the school; and such a splendid creature!
Certainly there can't be more than one.
"Say, 'I am fifteen, Miss Dove.'" Kathleen made a grimace.
Do you know anything about it, Miss Purcell?" "Perhaps she wants to question you about Miss O'Hara.
Your conduct requires stringent measures.
Why, you are quite as good as the others.
"I really am awfully sorry, but there is no help for it.
It isn't possible for every one to notice her; although, for my part, I have no patience with that sort of false pride.
There was a timid little girl called Janey Ford, who whispered to her friend that the Wild Irish Girls belonged to the rebels in Ireland, and that it might be considered necessary by the government of the country to have them taken up and put into prison.
The best china was very pretty, and Susy thought that no table could look more elegant than theirs.
We have, as it were, to uphold the spirit of the school.
She saw something in Cassandra's eye which made her slightly shiver.
Kate Rourke, of course, must come; and dear little Ruth Craven.
"Do you know what they are doing?" "What?" "They are bringing pressure to bear upon Ruth Craven.
Have you any objection?" Kathleen did not wait for Alice's answer.
They were accustomed to see her there, for old Mr.
Oh, miss, it's a beautiful country!
"And when all is said and done, you will have to remember that you owe it to me.
High Life and Low Life 17 III.
As Ruth came in he turned and smiled at her.
The Irish girl looked quite happy that day; she had something to interest her at last.
Church's sitting-room from her bedroom.
I dream of it at night, and think of it every minute of the day." "Come here and look me in the eyes, Tom," said Mrs.
Hopkins regarded them with pride.
"You are very low down in the school.
I shall be very pleased if you will join Ruth and me in our walk.
Susy Hopkins was quite an ordinary-looking little girl.
She was a widow with two sons and a daughter, and something under two hundred and fifty pounds a year on which to live.
"She thought it right, but something dreadful is going to happen.
With that leader the governors will deal.
Of course, my only chance of getting to the station was to go by the long way.--Half-way there I came across your mother, Susy, and she tried to stop me, and said she must speak to me.
Kate had made up her mind not to take the least notice of Susy.
She knew that the little girl was very poor and very clever.
I really don't see why we should make the poor child miserable," said Mary Denny.
I met her yesterday, and she decided to do it.
"They funked it, almost all of them.
The action was done so neatly, and in fact so beautifully, that Alice in spite of herself felt inclined to cry "Bravo!" She knew that if she were to trust herself to that ivy she would probably fall to the bottom and get, if not really killed, at least half so.
"I have a great mind to take to you all, to make a fuss about you, and to show the others how badly they behave." "You'd be a queen amongst us; there's no doubt about that." "It would be lovely, and it would be a tremendous bit of naughtiness," thought Kathleen.
But Kathleen felt she loved her all the better for it.
After a time she said: "Darling." "I wish you wouldn't talk to me in that silly way." "Faith!
The ground was crisp under foot; the air was soft, gentle, and pleasant.
"What would most aggravate Pat if he were here," thought the girl, "or dear old Michael?
She won't shut you out another time.
Miss O'Flynn took her niece to Dublin with her, and gave her an expensive and very unnecessary wardrobe; and Mrs.
"I saw you there to-day.
There was evidently a moment's pause, and the whole school was in a waiting attitude when Kathleen made her appearance.
The result of this communication was that, the curtain having fallen for the last time, the actors having left the stage, the play being completely over, and the seven girls being about to get back to Charing Cross as best they could, the lady touched Kathleen on her arm.
School had very nearly come to an end when the dread summons which both Ruth Craven and Alice Tennant expected arrived for Kathleen.
Kathleen, although she had been brought up in a considerable amount of wasteful splendor, was indifferent to what she ate.
The Tennants were, after all, not a large family.
Tennant's bedroom looked also into the garden, and was really parallel with the window by which Kathleen meant to escape.
Kathleen stood still for a moment; then she glanced at the clock.
"I think," she added, "I love you all already, and there is nothing on earth I wouldn't do for you." "Hear her, the dear!
"Are you now a member of that society?" "No." "Why did you join it?" "Because I loved Kathleen O'Hara." "She is the promoter, then?" Ruth was silent.
I pity that poor girl.
No one quite knew what happened next.
She noticed nothing amiss on her return, and went tranquilly on with her work.
End of the Great Rebellion 334 THE REBEL OF THE SCHOOL CHAPTER I.
Everything was arranged in a great hurry.
Cassandra was working very hard for one of the big scholarships, and her mother had gone to the expense of getting a special coach to help her at home.
Kathleen had never left Carrigrohane Castle before.
Temptation tugged at her heart.
Ruth was in a high class for her age, and was already absorbed in her work.
And now let us hurry home.
Kathleen stopped for a minute.
She was jealous of the paying girls of the school; but she treated Susy as some one beneath contempt.
Oh, Susy, it would break my heart if Ruth did not continue to be a member of our society." "I will do what you want, of course," said Susy.
Would the governors forgive their queen, just because she was an Irish girl and like no one else?
Why should she take up with a little girl like you?" "Well, Tom, some people like me, although you think but little of your sister.
There she is, crossing the field.
And do look at her!
Mother, must we keep her long?
I am going to be very late, so you can go on by yourself, Alice." Alice very nearly stamped her foot.
or two out of that charming Miss O'Flynn; mean to coax Aunty Church to give me that microscope when she moves across the sea to Ireland.
I can tell your special friend Kathleen, who will no longer be queen of the Wild Irish Girls, to-morrow morning, that I have forced this confession out of you.

Susy Hopkins Persuades Aunt Church 220 XIX.
I got your note after I had read the telegram.
How am I to bear it?" said Kathleen, and she clasped a white hand over that organ.
Kathleen gave a puzzled glance around her for a minute, then walked boldly up to a porter, asked him to direct her to the proper place to book for London.
Ruth was Kathleen's greatest friend.
David suggested that the messenger boy might have one.
"The rule must be held," she said.
"Yes; is she within?" asked Susy.
The girls whom she took into her own house and helped with her own counsel were thought the luckiest in England.
"And I shall fetch it for him as long as he wants it.
Alice was seldom downstairs until past eight.
He was the only child I ever had, and if I live to be a hundred I sha'n't get over his death.
Only that I never cross you, Kathleen, I'd have written to know the meaning of it." "It doesn't matter about you knowing." Here Kathleen briefly and in graphic language described the Society of the Wild Irish Girls.
"Here's something to delight the heart.
Naylor, "your object in coming to school is doubtless the best object of all." Ruth raised inquiring eyes.
You are certain to be asked." "But I don't know her.
I'm sorry you suffer from rheumatism.
It only needed a brave heart and a firm foot, and courage which nothing could daunt; and the other girls, the thirty-eight who were to join Kathleen and Susy, would keep them company.
"Why, you have crowned me queen yourselves.
They now tripped confidently along by the side of the porter.
"I was with a girl to-day who is fifty times too good for me." "What nonsense you are talking, Cassandra!
I have come in rather late, very much fagged out from a day of hard examination work and that imp--that horrid girl--has locked me out of my bedroom.
I must go back, for grandfather would be terrified if I didn't go home.
Once I went with my grandfather, and another time with an uncle from Australia.
She was not a lady by birth; she had not a single instinct of a true lady within her; but she was intensely ambitious.
But I will only tell it to you on condition." Mrs.
Hopkins, in some trepidation, crossed the room and called to Susy, who was still sulking in the shop.
She seemed to have a kind-hearted sort of face." "She's as right as rain, aunty; and so are the two boys.
They pressed close together, and one peeped over the shoulder of her companion, another stood on tiptoe, while a third tried to snatch the letter from the hand of her fellow; but all managed to read the words: "Get as many foundation girls as you can to meet me, at whatever place you like to appoint, this evening.
"They will hear you." "And what do I care if they do, darling?
What sort of lessons are they going to put into that smart little head of yours?" "Oh, all the best things, grandfather--French, German, English in all its branches, music, and Latin if I like.
This child in appearance is one of Nature's ladies, but we must get her to see things in the right light, and if necessary she must be made an example of.
Have you made the tea, Mrs.
I don't know what I should have done if I hadn't recalled that Mrs.
The school was situated in the suburbs of the popular town of Merrifield, and was known as the Great Shirley School.
The girls themselves will have forgiveness." Miss Ravenscroft again paused.
"What fun it all will be!" The girls laughed, and clustered with more and more friendliness round Kathleen.
Kathleen was walking across the common.
Craven did not keep any servants.
"Be sure you don't lock the door," called Alice after her.
"And now I want to know if you are prepared to stand by me through thick and thin?" "That we are!" was shouted in one vivid, clear girlish note.
You and I could work every evening together; I could, and would, see you through your lessons.
An eager exclamation was about to burst from her lips, but she restrained herself.
you don't know how happy you are making me." Ruth smiled and tried to look cheerful.
"All right, my boy; I expect I am," said Kathleen; and then she added, springing to her feet, "I have eaten enough, and for what we have received--Good-bye, Mrs.
I force my treasures on nobody." "I wouldn't wear them if you were to give them.
He held out his hand and drew her in.
She had on purpose moved close to the Great Shirley School in order to avail herself of its cheap education for Alice.
"But surely the fact that there are a few naughty girls in our midst need not upset the whole school?" "It upsets me, anyhow," said Alice, "for I feel that I have brought it on the school.
Ah, yes; it's lonely I am.
But, of course, we are not going up to London," said Alice.
You owe me between thirty and forty pounds, and I'd like, I will say, to see the color of my money.
What a little goose she was!" "She was led into it by Kathleen.
Kathleen and Ruth, did they but know it, made a most charming contrast as they walked arm-in-arm across the common; for Ruth belonged more or less to the twilight and the evening star, and Kathleen--her face, her eyes, her voice, her actions--spoke to those who had eyes to see of the morning.
She stepped softly, reached her own bed, undressed, and lay down.
"Presently, darling," replied Kathleen in her most nonchalant tone.
Kathleen in the gray darkness looked down at her.
The conference hastily ended, and on entering the school Susy pinned a piece of paper under Kathleen's desk, on which she wrote: "The old quarry; nine o'clock this evening.
Their positions are not so very pleasant as it is, poor things!" "Perhaps sixty are about as many as we can manage for the present," said Kathleen.
"I can understand," she continued; "and I am proud of him." "So he went into the army.
"I am going up to bed as usual, and when mother and Alice and Dave are safe in their rooms I'll slip down again.
I know I'm doing wrong, but you did offer me such a tremendous temptation.
I mean, you want crutches when you are forty, don't you?" "Not as a rule, my dear.
My eyes can almost pierce through the deal and see the lovely garments folded away inside." Alice took no notice; she marched on to her room.
Come in, dear; come in." Mrs.
We are obliged to supply them with as much coal as they want, and candles, and a new pair of blankets on the first of every November, and a bale of unbleached calico on the first of May.
She said I was to see you to-day, and I was to take her back the answer.
The child is very unhappy.
I know so little about the school." "Certain?
Kathleen O'Hara, walking home that day in the company of Susy Hopkins, eagerly questioned that young lady.
"I asked your darling, saintly sister just now which was the most wicked--to tell a polite lie, or a frightfully rude home truth.
Truly the fun was all over; the dregs of the cup of pleasure were in their mouths, and there was a fear, great, certain, and very terrible, in their hearts.
"I am going to do it just to defy them.
There was nothing in the cottage for Mrs.
"Now, to tell the truth, I can't bear that sister of yours--Susy, you call her--but I have a liking for you, Tom Hopkins.
Half a moment later she was in the fresh air outside.
She went up to him and closed the big account-book.
She ran up the tiny stairs, and entered her own little bedroom, which was so wee that she could scarcely turn round in it, but was extremely neat.
"I took it out and put it at her feet; and if you'll believe me, she spurned it.
It's a fine time I mean to have.
I don't want to appeal to mother or to be rude to the poor wild thing the first day.
"That grand beauty of a young lady, the pride of the school?
The night was sufficiently cold to make them somewhat chill, and the fears which little Janey Ford had put into their hearts began to grow greater and more fixed each moment.
"I mean to have my fun," he said; "and don't you suppose for a moment I'm going to funk a lot of stupid, silly girls.
Church her two pounds fifteen shillings and sevenpence on the first of every month.
They seal you as my loving friends and followers for ever and ever." Girls are easily impressed, and Kathleen's words were so fervent that some of them felt quite choky about the throat.
Their names were, of course, Susy Hopkins, who considered herself on this delightful occasion quite the leader; a gentle and refined-looking girl of the name of Mary Rand; Rosy Myers, who was pretty and frivolous, with dark eyes and fair hair; Clara Sawyer, who was renowned for her vulgar taste in dress; and Hannah Johnson, a heavy-looking girl with a scowling brow and a very pronounced jaw.
We could die for you," said one or two.
She said after a pause that she was willing to reconsider matters, and that she and all the other governors would meet in a day or two to give their opinion.
"Don't you see," she said impatiently, "that I want to give away some of these things?
You ought, after Christmas, to get into a class at least two removes higher up in the school.
The wilfullness of young folks in these days is past enduring.
I shall probably be a teacher in this very school, and get my couple of hundred a year.
She bent low over her treasure, examining the blue embroidery, which was rendered still more fascinating with small stitches of pink silk, looking with ecstacy at the real lace round the neck and cuffs and finally pressing the delicate color against her blooming cheek.
when I put mine on on Sunday mother will gape.
As to the Irish girl, she had scarcely noticed her up to the present.
Her face, which had been quite florid, turned pale.
The old lady looked very nice; but, of course, she is quite a common person.
"I tell you what it is, Kathleen, I feel rather frightened.
Craven; "it gives you a chance.
Thus ended the great rebellion.
But he was like you--very neat in his person, and very particular, and always keen over his books.
Do you know, now, when I look at you and see the pretty little girl you are turning into, and observe your lady-like ways, which every one remarks on, I think of the time when your father was your age." "Yes, granny," said Ruth, brightening up and looking earnestly at the old lady; "you never care to talk about father, but I should greatly like to hear about him this morning." "Well, child, I don't talk of him because it hurts me too much.
You are talking pure nonsense, Susan Hopkins, and I'll break my word if that's all you have to tell." "It's true enough.
Florence loved it and hated it at the same time.
The worst that could happen to us is to be expelled from the school." Now this worst, which was really a matter of little importance in the eyes of Kathleen, was somewhat serious to the other girls.
She must be out of the house in a little over a quarter of an hour if she was to meet Ruth Craven at the White Cross Corner.
Cassandra hoped to have a talk with Ruth before she went home, but when she looked round for her little favorite she could not find her anywhere.
"Now we are complete," she said.
I am going upstairs to fetch my books.
Where did you get that bodice?
She was educated in a sort of fashion by an Irish governess, but in reality she was allowed to pursue her lessons exactly as she liked best herself.
There's many a small business like mine which, when built up, means a great big business and much wealth.
Ross, the Misses Scott, and Miss Jane Smyth.
Tennant's house at a quarter to one.
She offered me the services of her own coach in order that I might work up for the Ayldice Scholarship." "And do you think you have a chance of getting it?" "I don't know.
THE SCHOLARSHIP: TROUBLE IS BREWING.
"But I do hope you will marshal those dreadful girls into the backyard without frightening my hens or Brownie." "Pigs aren't remarkable for sensitiveness," said Susy.
It was not a particularly tempting meal, and those who ate it required to have good, vigorous appetites.
"I love old ladies." She pushed past Susy and made her appearance in the parlor.
The next instant David had opened the door with his latchkey, and Kathleen was waiting for them in the hall.
I know I oughtn't to tell you, but she is.
Oh, what did it mean?
They belong to Ireland and to me--to the home of the free and to Kathleen O'Hara.
Has the dream about the shop and the wrong accounts passed out of your head?" "Why, yes, darling; of course it was only a dream." "Then I'd like to ask you something." "Ask away, my little Ruth.
Why should we put off till next week our picnic to town?
"Oh, mother," cried the girl, "where is Kathleen?
You are good--you are wonderfully good." "Where's the quarry?" asked Kathleen.
It seemed to her that if she let her soul go it would mount on that breeze and get up high above the clouds and the temptations of earth.
Oh, this is lovely, isn't it, Ruth?" "Thank goodness I'm not always bothered by that dreadful speaking voice inside me that you seem to have got," said Kathleen.
She felt much more sober than she had done in the morning; she was inclined to think, to consider her ways.
I am sorry my dear husband is not as well as could be wished; but perhaps if you'd be good enough to sit down for a minute or two, he would wake up before you go." Kathleen entered, held out her hand, greeted Mrs.
Besides, it wouldn't be true, for I have given it to you, dear.
Nothing would induce her not to work with her usual diligence, but when on certain occasions she raised her head she saw that Florence Archer was watching her with curiosity and affection, and that Ruth darted quick glances at her and then bent her head, with its curly hair falling over her face, to resume her lessons.
"I live there," said Kathleen--"that is, I do when I am at home.
I do admire her just!" The shop-bell rang.
She is lying now on the bed with her outdoor boots on, and she won't come to school, or do a single thing I want her to." "The money her father pays will be very welcome, Alice.
I never saw anything uglier than poor old Towser when he broke his leg and cut his upper jaw; but although he was ugly, he was the darling of my heart.
Church was quite rich, according to the Hopkinses' ideas of wealth.
"Where in the world are you going?" said her mother in a fretful tone.
I am going to be chummy with you.
"I expect you will punish me for this, Miss Spicer, but I am sorry--I can't help myself." Strange to say, Miss Spicer did not punish her.
Now, who amongst the schoolgirls will suit me?
"I have been wondering what sort you are.
She said next time I came along she'd show me things in her microscope.
And gloves--here's a pair, and they're neatly mended.
It is my opinion she will get into very serious trouble before she leaves Great Shirley School.
Why, my dear Alice, how excited you look!" "I have cause to be, mother.
Susy and Tom watched her as she ate the egg, and thought how delicious it must taste, but were glad she had it.
Even the trustees of the trust fund were women.
"Do you know anything whatever of the disgraceful escapade which took place last night, when a certain number of the members of this society went to London and returned by themselves at midnight?" Ruth's face cleared a little at this question.
Kathleen saw at once that she was one of the Great Shirley girls, so she went forward and spoke to her.
"Mother always keeps a supply of stamps in the till." She turned to the till as she spoke, and for the first time noticed that the drawer was open.
"I was never _very_ naughty with Michael," she said to herself.
She opened it and placed it on the ground; a bright shaft of light now fell on several young figures all huddled together.
it's I who pine to be home again." "It will broaden your mind, Kathleen, and improve you.
I always keep three cakes in three tin boxes, and you can have a morsel of the stalest; it is more than two months old, but you won't mind that." "Not me," said Tom, "I like stale cakes best," he added, determined to show his aunt that he was ready to be pleased with everything.
Weldon," said Ruth; "and I scarcely know how to thank you." "Come in, dear, and have some dinner.--Cassandra, I have just heard from Miss Renshaw, and she is coming this afternoon.--You can either stay, Ruth, when dinner is over, or come back again." "I will come back," said Ruth.
And you'll just pinch that pig and make him squeal like anything." Tom laughed.
I shall love you even if I don't belong to the society.
At this moment Kathleen O'Hara was seen passing through the playground in a sort of triumphal progress.
She did not say anything further but left the room.
Do you see this dozen of blouses, all exactly alike, in this box?
Nobody believes in them," said Alice.
Miss Ravenscroft talked to her a little longer, but Ruth was firm.
What do you mean now?" "I mean just what I say.
But it is not Aunt Church's affair.
"Well, little woman," said the old man, "and you are off to school?
Church's face became very bleak and decidedly wintry in appearance.
And when there's some one else to mend the boys' socks, perhaps I won't offer; but until there is, the less you say about such things the better, Miss Alice Tennant." Ben kicked David under the table, and David kicked him back to stay quiet.
Oh, Garry Owen, Garry Owen!
Cassandra has been telling me about you.
"Ah, Tom!" she said, "I have got a piece of plumcake waiting for you; and if you are a really good boy, and will shoo the fowls into my backyard and shut the gate on them, you may look into my microscope." "Thank you, Aunt Church," said Tom.
She felt very much elated and really pleased.
It is an unpleasant ceremony, and one which you will never be able to forget; it will haunt you for life, Ruth Craven.
There was no recent improvement in education, no better methods, no sanitary requirements which were not introduced into the Great Shirley School.
Good-bye, Aunt Church; good-bye." Susy got as far as the door when Mrs.
I want them to be Tom's some day.
"I can't say," or "I will not say," were the only words that were wrung from her lips.
"How tiresome of you to rouse me!" said Alice, opening her eyes and looking crossly at Kathleen.
Tom winked when he saw the splendid apparition; then he stuck his tongue into his cheek, and coming close to his sister, he whispered: "Wherever did you get that toggery?" "That's nothing to you," said Susy.
Weldon to Cassandra, and then she looked at Ruth.
Read it, and give me the answer where I have asked you." Susy Hopkins, a most ordinary little girl, who had no position of any sort in the school, colored high with delight.
I grieve to say that a box of finery has arrived for Kathleen--most unsuitable, for she has plenty of clothes.
And where's the little Irish beauty?" "For goodness' sake don't speak about her," said Alice.
As a rule she was very calm, but now her heart beat too fast.
She told Kathleen so much about her life that she was interested in spite of herself!
And one does it sometimes in life.
The girls got excellent seats, and found themselves in the front row of the family circle.
Church seemed to sniff the fine quality air in a moment; she even managed to rise from her chair and drop a little curtsy.
It never yet disagreed with me; but then I've got the digestion of an ostrich." "Indeed, then, madam, I think you are rather silly to eat the comb," said Mrs.
I am going to write to father.
"It's from Aunt Katie O'Flynn.
I know it is a good bit farther, but she is not in it with me as far as running is concerned," was Kathleen's thought.
Stay and visit with me, and tell me about the old country and the sea and the mountains," said Mrs.
There was not the slightest hesitation in the words she uttered.
He came back the next instant with a telegram, which was addressed to Miss O'Flynn.
What was there in the young face that stimulated, that caused fear to slink out of sight and courage to come to the fore, that caused hearts to beat high with generous emotion?
Kathleen, however, was much taken by their schoolboyish ways.
MISS KATIE O'FLYNN AND HER NIECE.
I was a bit of a scholar when I was young, although I made my money in grocery.
She wished to hear from her father; she wanted to have money in hand.
he had forgotten all about it for a weary long while.
They looked regretful, but saw nothing for it but to go.
And set me swimming in the cold sea; I can turn somersaults and dive and dance on the waves, and do every mortal thing as though I were a fish, not a girl.
"Would you like me to shut the ventilator in the grate?" she then asked.
I like her, of course, but I think she is mistaken.
As soon as Susy returned from her place of worship she helped her mother to get the little parlor ready.
She praised Susy in honeyed words to the visitor.
We were forced to put her into much too low a class for her years and general appearance." "Well," said Miss Smyth, "that, after all, isn't a crime.
By-and-by she and Ruth Craven found themselves the only girls who were walking down the road called Southwood Lane.
Oh, glory be to goodness!
No, that isn't the shoe you want; here it is.
"She is most lovely." "She's better," said Susy; "she's bewitching.
Do you mind if I put my hand on your hair and stroke it just because of grandfather?" "Ah, my dear, you may do what you like," said the old man.
But just as the thought came to her, Miss Mackenzie, the woman most respected and most dreaded in the whole of Merrifield, rose slowly to her feet.
That is in Oxford Street.
His father reminded me of his words: 'I'd like to be that for which I could give my life if necessary,'" There was quite a pink color in each of Ruth's cheeks now, and her eyes were very bright.
On every possible occasion they were avoided, and there must be something very special about any one of them if she was taken up by the aristocrats--as they termed themselves--of the school.
She did not suppose the matter was of special import.
"Girls of the Great Shirley School," she said, "your head-mistress, Miss Ravenscroft, has conveyed to you a message from me and from the other governors.
She should love the soil of her native land with a passion which nothing could undermine or weaken.
A spirit of defiance came over her.
If her ideas were wrong, they were at least generous; and you know that I won't trouble you any more.
"And you really mean that you would introduce that girl to Mrs.
Before Kathleen arrived at the school Susy was a good little girl, who helped her mother in the shop, and had dreams of going into another shop herself by-and-by.
I am sometimes inclined to believe that it comes afore pride; but we needn't dispute that delicate point at present.
"All I want is just to look into your face.
"I am glad I got into the school," she said.
I want some one to help me; if some one will help me, I will be nice to that person.
The friend had, as usually is the case, become bankrupt.
Ruth walked slowly and as if she were tired.
"Oh, if I had Alice here, wouldn't I give it to her?" she said to herself.
Are you awfully old?" "You would think me so," replied Mrs.
She is the sort of girl that you'd take a fancy to when you're lonely and far from home.
"Well," said Kathleen, "I am queen, and I have my Cabinet.
Kathleen's eyes were fixed on the window; they were brimful of mischief.
"I have overheard you," said Miss Weldon calmly.
Now, there is not the slightest doubt that the society which you girls--a certain number of you--have joined is rebellious, has bad effects, and has rules of its own which are absolutely contrary to the rules of the Great Shirley School.
She was in reality not at all afraid of what might be going to happen at school.
She asked me questions with regard to you and your doings which, of course, I could not answer; but you will have to answer them.
What shall I do that will most aggravate them?
I haven't any; but then I have lots of boy cousins, which comes to much the same thing." The girls by this time had reached the large bedroom which they shared on the first floor.
Her beauty, her daring and wild manner, the flash in her bright dark eyes, the glints of gold in her lovely hair, all fascinated Susy.
But as this was for private wear, and must on no account be shown to any one who was not a member of the society, it did not give her the amount of rapture it would otherwise have done.
She despised herself for her own action, but she did not dread discovery.
And I will sit with you this afternoon, mother, and help you to sew.
She doesn't understand our ways.
Her beautiful, fair, delicately chiselled face had turned pale.
The governors sat in a little circle, Miss Mackenzie in the middle.
I shall slip down and go the long way.
Perhaps one of the porters can tell me when there is a train to Merrifield.
There was absolute despair in the eyes generally so clear and steadfast and bright.
To please Alice I'd have to be the primmest of the prim, and always stooping over my horrid lessons, and the end of it there'd be no more of poor Kathleen O'Hara--- it's dead and in her grave she'd be, the creature.
Cassandra came close to her and looked into her face.
They knew, of course, that Miss Ravenscroft would be furiously angry, that the governors would have something to say to them, and that they might be dismissed from the school unless they promised to cease to belong to the society.
"This will never do." She roused herself, and bending forward, propped her book open before her.
Oh dear, why will you drag all this out of me?
Ben was sitting up for her; he opened the door.
It is a big rise for me.
Her neat satchel of school-books was slung on her arm.
"I have promised granny that I would help her with some darning this afternoon." "Your granny must do without you, for you have got to come back with me." "Oh, indeed, I can't!" "But you must, my little girl.
If you don't know, I'd like to tell you." "Yes, do tell us," cried several.
She was indifferent now as to what she wore.
Tennant, but I am privately engaged in my own half of the room.
no one agrees with me.
Craven was in her Sunday best, and looked a very beautiful and almost aristocratic old lady.
He was a plain, sandy-haired boy, with a freckled face, a wide mouth, and good-humored blue eyes.
It nearly finished me, but I steadied myself and got across.
Tennant ran upstairs in some alarm.
She did not darn well; but then, Mrs.
In all respects they were supposed to be Florence's equals, but as a matter of fact they were kept in a very subordinate position by the paying girls.
Perhaps they will if you ask them." "Thanks," replied Kathleen; "I am not going." Again there was silence, and the scratching of the pen continued.
Kathleen was intensely affectionate, and would have done anything in the world to please Mrs.
"I have aired beds for quality of that sort, and I have watched them when they danced in the big ballroom, and watched them, too, when their sweethearts came along, and seen--oh, yes, many, many things have I seen, and many, many things have I heard of those fair young ladies of quality.
Tennant was in reality not at all old, and she looked quite young and pretty in the new toque.
I suppose it is wicked, but then that makes it rather more fascinating." "We are in the queen's Cabinet, bless her, the duck!" said Susy Hopkins.
Still, I faithfully promise to do what I can." Cassandra left the presence of Miss Ravenscroft and returned to her place in class.
I have got such a lovely scheme in my head.
Hopkins's way to reproach her children; she bore her burden with regard to them as silently and patiently as she could.
the lights--aren't they just lovely?
That's the way of girls.
I raced her across the common, and then to get rid of her I climbed up into an oak-tree.
Nineteen-and-sixpence had been abstracted from the till.
I rather fancy that will decide matters." Kathleen tore open the note which Alice had handed to her.
I did, darling; I did.
"Why, Kathleen, any one would suppose you were going to a concert," said Mrs.
I am not touching your beautiful half; I am only in mine." "Let me in," called Alice again, "and don't be silly." "Sorry, dear; don't think I am silly." There was a silence.
"Yes, miss," answered the girl, dropping a little curtsy when she saw Kathleen.
Kathleen lives with the Tennants.
She slept in a tiny room just at the back of her mother's; it was sparsely furnished, and had a sloping roof at one side.
It will be a lark.
She never likes to see a smile on my face, and she can't abide to watch me if I dance a step, and she wouldn't take a joke out of me if it was to save her life.
I hope you will be better to-morrow.
Hopkins came back at that moment.
They moved away to that lonely part of the playground which was situated at the back of the Botanical Laboratory.
But, as I said, I was not displeased at the end.
And the time to catch the train was very short.
A girl who wears a dress like this ought to be very, very good, oughtn't she, granny?" "Well, to be sure, little woman; and so you are.
She ate her meal soberly, but occasionally a bubble of laughter came to the surface, and her merry eyes glanced from Mrs.
Miss Ravenscroft has nothing whatever to do with me." "Oh, Kathleen!
Will you say that you know that I got this blouse honestly?" "Oh, yes, child!
It is impossible for you to be members of this society and to be members of the Great Shirley School.
I didn't find her in her room, and I wondered what had become of her." "Where is she?" said Mrs.
Tennant, feeling very much like a naughty child herself, enjoyed her tea.
"You know the Irish girl who has come to live with the Tennants?" "Can't say I do," said Kate.
"And they will press you hard." Still Ruth made no answer.
Church was a person of discernment.
Tennant turned and spoke to her daughter.
It must therefore be put a stop to, and the first way to put a stop to anything of the sort is to discover all about it.
The girls who have joined your society and are putting themselves under your influence are the sort of girls who in a school like this get most injured by such proceedings.
This was placed on the table which was arranged in the yard for the purpose, and its light fell now on the vivid coloring and beautiful face of the Irish girl.
The next moment the good lady had departed, and Kathleen, looking thoroughly bewildered, was left alone.
You are not to repeat it to anybody.
She was firmer now, and quite resolved.
Aunt Katie O'Flynn is going to send me a box of clothes from Dublin, and I will give you some of them.
Now, there are certain principles which every girl who comes into this school is bound to adhere to.
David was now whistling right into her room "The Wearing of the Green." Kathleen flung down her pen, making a splash on the paper.
you will come along upstairs with me at once.
It will be madness to refuse.
"It's all right; it's splendidly right.
I hope, my dear, you are not working too hard." "Oh, that's all right," said Ruth, keeping back a groan.
It is somewhat hard on me that Ruth Craven should have come between us." "But she hasn't.
That means sixty pounds a year.
It is Aunt Katie O'Flynn, you know, the lady who sent me the beautiful, wonderful clothes." But here Miss O'Flynn herself appeared on the scene.
Tennant began to hunt about for one.
"You hardly ever ask me to your house, and when I ask you to mine you always have an excuse ready.
It was at that moment that Kathleen calmly and slowly raised her face and looked around her.
Tennant could make out, people who were of the greatest importance to her had left messages, and yet none of the messages could be attended to.
It is a sort of melodrama; there's a deal of killing in it, and the heroine has to do some desperate deeds." "Oh, dear!" said Susy, with a sigh; "I don't feel, somehow, as if I much cared where we went.
I can't stay in that horrid school." "Oh, yes, you can.
"It would be glorious," she continued.
After that there was silence.
She kept glancing at Susy Hopkins, and Susy Hopkins once very boldly winked at her; and when she did this one of the under teachers saw her.
It's fine I'll look when I have them on.
It would do a lot of mischief if the school heard of it, and we would most likely be expelled.
And I have a little water-color sketch of my mother, and she looks fair and sweet and interesting.
There'd be no horrid shop then, and no horrid women coming in for ha'p'orths and penn'orths of paper." But as she ran through the autumn night-air she felt that, after all, there was something good in life.
She was rapidly approaching the proud position of head girl in the school.
In the whole course of her life she had never met a girl of the Kathleen O'Hara type before.
I will presently." Susy was now thoroughly enjoying herself.
She escaped the treacherous second step, and entered her bedroom without waking Alice.
it is you that are kind.
Her opinion was asked by anxious mothers and fathers and guardians.
Whatever happens, neither father nor Aunt Katie, nor Ruth Craven can keep me back." CHAPTER XXV.
How handsome you look when you flash your eyes!" said Susy Hopkins.
Ross had a husband and a beautiful home; she dressed remarkably well, and was looked down on in consequence by Miss Mackenzie.
Church made a grab at it, and held it tightly in her hand, which was covered by a black mitten.
Susy had heard of those few people of rare character and rare natures who are, as it is expressed, "Nature's ladies." There are Nature's gentlemen as well, and Nature's ladies and Nature's gentlemen are above mere external circumstances; they are above the mere money's worth or the mere accident of birth.
I know that you are an Irish girl, and you must be lonely.
She had a vivacious, merry smile, the keenest, most brilliant black eyes in the world, and a certain grace and dignity about her which seemed to contrast with her rapid utterances and intensely genial manner.
She opened it and went in.
Something very unusual is detaining mother.
You'd have taken an hour hobbling round all by yourself.
"The window is a little open," said Kathleen.
A few more questions were asked, Ruth replying on every occasion in the negative.
Her hands were small and white.
In the interest of their own conversation they forgot Kathleen.
"Why, I never!" she cried.
And now, may I begin to look through my lessons for to-morrow?" The old man arranged the lamp where its light would be most comfortable for the keen young eyes, and Ruth sat down to the table, got out her books, and worked for an hour or two.
Kathleen flung off her hat, and the light from the lamps lit up her brilliant hair.
I should not loathe it so much if it was not for Alice." "Ah!
Naylor was the oldest of the governors.
"I know her kind," thought Aunt Church.
Isn't London a perfect place?
And she has got a drop of water full of wriggly things all alive; and she says we drink it by the gallon, and it is no wonder we feel bad in our insides.
"Some of these things are a little too fine for everyday use," she said.
You generally wait to talk to me after school is over.
"If it weren't for the rheumatics," she said, "I wouldn't make so bold as to sit before you, miss." "But why shouldn't you?
It is really most exciting." The girls talked a little longer and then parted.
What do you say to Carrigrohane in the summer, and a gun all to yourself?
Why, do you think I'd let this precious darling child back again in the middle of the night?
Church's very humble abode between three and four o'clock.
I wouldn't like us all to be as fagged as she is--poor, dear, gentle soul!
Did you ever hear of a girl who lived in a castle--a great beautiful castle--on the top of a high hill?
She worked just as assiduously as though nothing was happening.
I think she has saved three hundred pounds.
You had all the world to choose from.
Hopkins left the house, and Tom sank into a chair by his sister.
She played with perfect correctness--with fire, with spirit.
I have known good genteel living in my lifetime, and I expect that Providence means me to know it again before I die.
She opened a drawer, substituted a clean collar for the one she had been wearing during the day, brushed out her satin-brown hair neatly, put on her sailor-hat and a small black coat, snatched up a pair of gloves, and ran downstairs.
At last they found one and tumbled into it; the door was slammed, and they were off.
Here is the box; you drop it in: two pounds in gold--I hope to goodness your mother has sent the money in gold--two pounds in gold and the rest in silver.
She ran across the common, and reached the doors of the great school exactly one hour after she ought to have arrived.
Kathleen seems to have a singular power over them." "But Ruth doesn't belong to it now." "No.
Susy was silent for a moment.
She talked with high spirits all the time; and although she liked David and was much comforted by his words and his actions, he did not get at the real Kathleen at all.
"Here is a porter who looks kind." She went up to the man.
"I do hate messy dishes.
"I do hate her very much indeed.
the window was partly open.
"Granddad," she said after a pause, "is it the best thing--quite the best thing--always to come out on the right side of the ledger?" "Eh?
The floor for an instant seemed to rise up as though it would strike her; then she felt composed, but very cold and white.
Even Alice, who was reckoned a good girl as good girls go, had never before come in personal contact with Miss Ravenscroft.
I suppose she is in a hurry to get home." "Thank you," said Cassandra.
"Is it true," continued the head-mistress, "that you have started a society which is called by some ridiculous name such as The Wild Irish Girls, and that you meet each week in a quarry a short distance from town; that you have got rules and badges; that you sing naughty songs, and altogether misbehave yourselves?
I have got up my headache already, in order to go to my room and thus avoid all suspicion." "Oh dear!" said Susy.
There's bread, and there's butter--Dorset, second-class Dorset--and there's jam (if there's any left); and that's about all." "That sort of tea isn't very nourishing, cook, is it?
"Be sure you come and tell me afterwards what it all means, Cassie," said Florence, touching her friend affectionately on the shoulder.
It so happened that they had a compartment to themselves.
I have been sent here, and here I am.
And now I must consider whom I am to give the other things to." When Kathleen had finally parcelled out her treasures there was not such a great deal left for herself, for this girl and the other who had taken her fancy were all allotted a treasure out of that famous box.
She has thrown ridicule upon me.
I'll tell her you expect to get the almshouse after doing so much as to entertain forty of her guests." "Well, look here, Susy, you have thrust yourself into this matter, and you must help me out.
There was a sort of suppressed excitement in the school; but the teachers remarked nothing.
"I will stay here for a little," she said finally to Mrs.
Ruth softly unlatched the door and peeped in.
Now Kathleen's ideas of what a great lady should be were in themselves very sensible and noble.
A great lady should do her utmost to make others happy.
And I never could spell properly; and what does it matter?" "Everything," replied Alice.
"I think we are now in possession of the facts," said Miss Mackenzie.
It certainly would," said Kathleen.
She will be sorry yet; I know she will." CHAPTER XV.
We tell a few lies now and then, but they are only _polite_ lies--the kind that make other people happy.
I must follow her, of course," said Mrs.
"A plumcake--" "Better and better!" cried Susy.
"Mother is right," she thought.
These rules are made not only to enable the girls to get the best possible education out of the school, but also that the greater education of mind and heart, which alone can build up a fine and useful character, may not be neglected.
"And you'd have so much to tell them; because all the rest are Irish, and they have never gone beyond their own country.
So Kathleen had thought when she left the house that morning; but as she entered the school she knew that one girl, and that the girl whom she most cared for, had decided to choose the thorny path which led far from Kathleen and her company.
But the accounts ain't balanced, Ruthie; we are on the wrong side of the ledger, my love--on the wrong side of the ledger." Ruth said nothing more.
"I scarcely know Miss Ravenscroft.
I have something to say." "Indeed!" Kathleen longed to be very rude, but she thought of her delightful plan so close at hand, and refrained.
She has written me a most mysterious letter; she has actually asked me to let her withdraw from our society.
It did not occur to him for one moment that the little girl was talking about herself.
"It is so awfully nice to have met you!
It was good of you to come and give me Kathleen's message." CHAPTER XIV.
"If I work desperately hard, and stop my ears so that I needn't hear a sound, I may have done by nine o'clock." Just at that moment two ladies came in to ask for a special sort of stationery.
But you ought to have tea for Miss O'Hara and Miss Katie O'Flynn; you really ought.
"And I wish you wouldn't stand between me and the lamp.
We will have some refreshments at a restaurant, and then we will go to the pit of one of the theatres.
Nevertheless a commonplace little girl like Susy Hopkins had not one thing in common with Kathleen.
I had to stay and see the doctor, and then to fetch the medicine myself, and then put the child to bed.
RUTH'S TROUBLES AND SUSY'S PREPARATIONS.
It means that Aunt Church will forgive you last month's installment of the debt, and perhaps next month's, too.
The face was undoubtedly sweet--sweet with a radiance which surprised and partly fascinated Miss Ravenscroft.
Her face was white, but this fact only increased the rare delicacy, the sort of fragrance, which her appearance always presented.
Maria, who was somewhat lazy, and who had already begun to appreciate Kathleen's extreme good-nature, handed her the toasting-fork and pointed to a heap of bread which lay cut and ready for toasting on the deal table in the center of the kitchen.
Do you ever feel your heart beat wild, dear, and your spirits all in a sort of throb?
"And what may that way be?" "Why, this: if you will tell the truth about your horrible society, and spare dear little Ruth Craven, and make Cassandra Weldon happy." "I don't care twopence about your tiresome Cassandra; but little Ruth--what ails her?" "The governors are going to insist upon her telling what she knows." "But she won't," said Kathleen, laughing merrily.
"She is a little better than she was.
I will not join nor advocate any plan that annoys or worries them." The girls looked dubious, and one or two began to speak in discontented voices.
"A school party, my dear," said a lady to her husband.
Miss O'Flynn gave orders which resulted in a rich and most unwholesome supper being placed upon the table.
The other ladies fidgeted as they sat.
Whether the blouse was becoming to Susy Hopkins or not remains to be proved, but it certainly delighted its wearer, causing her eyes to sparkle and the color in her cheeks to grow brighter.
She goes to bed at ten, I know, and I shall not be in until about half-past ten.
Alice awoke, and complained of the cold.
I don't mind Miss Spicer so much; she's the music teacher.
You yourself are an ignorant and unlearned child, and yet you attempt to guide others.
"It's golloptious for me," he said.
"We'll boil it and say nothing about it, and just pop it on her plate when she's having her supper.
The simplest plan is to get the girl herself to make a full confession to me; but in any case, you understand, _I must know_." CHAPTER XVI.
But a sudden meeting to be convened within forty-eight hours' notice was almost unheard of in their experience.
I should not have imagined that a quarry--a dear, romantic quarry--could be found anywhere in this neighborhood." "Yes, but there is, and a good big one, too.
Craven, bustling up and removing her cooking-apron.
Can't you manage it, dear Mrs.
Your affectionate daughter, "KATHLEEN." This letter was posted by Kathleen herself.
You would enjoy it; you'd have such a lovely view!
He lingered for a time, broken-hearted and unable to rouse himself, and finally died about three years before the date of this story.
You are young, and cannot know as much as we do.
She is refined and beautiful.
"I wish I could give you all a blouse apiece," she said to the other girls of the society, "but I am afraid that is not within my means.
And now I think I will get you your dinner." Ruth went out of the room into the little kitchen.
You can't blame me, can you?" Alice deigned no answer.
And the sleeves--aren't they just illegant entirely?
"But can't you wait just for once?" asked David.
She has the power of attracting people, but she has also the power of making enemies.
There is nothing I wouldn't do for you." "Thank you," said Ruth again.
You always treat me as if I were a baby." "Well, please yourself.
It is herself that is crossing the briny.
Will you do what I want, Ben--will you, dear Ben?
Susy looked up, uttered an exclamation, put wings to her feet, and ran the rest of the way home.
I do hope we'll have a right good time." With this sort of chatter the girls got to London.
You will win that scholarship." Ruth smiled.
There are about thirty of us now, and more and more offer to join every day.
"You make off now," she said.
Hopkins was so stunned that she could not speak for a moment.
For that would break mother's heart, and do none of us any good." "Oh, you little goose!" cried Kathleen, with her ringing laugh.
Surely we can afford to be kind to a little girl who has not our advantages." "Oh, if you put it in that way, I don't mind a bit," said Florence cheerfully.
Take it up to my bedroom and put it on the floor.
Ruth and Kathleen went into the garden.
I am busy preparing for my scholarship examination or I would stay and argue with you.
Were you ever in the old country, miss, if I might venture to ask a civil question?" "No," said Miss Atherton in a very suppressing tone.
Aren't you glad to see me, dear, sweet, pretty Ruth?
"And what on earth were you whispering about to yourself when I came in?" "I am going to work with her.
I don't know that I want to." "I am curious," said Kate.
He heard about it two nights ago, and that made me make up my mind.
"I can't do it," she said, looking Miss Spicer full in the face.
There was a field just beyond, and into this field the girls now strolled by twos and twos.
Once, too, he jingled the sovereign in his pocket; she heard him, and wondered why David did not ask him where he had got the money.
"Can't we defer talking of the charms of Kathleen's character until after I have done my lessons?" "Of course, dear," said her mother.
When she came down this morning she saw, to her amazement, Kathleen helping the very untidy maid-of-all-work to lay the breakfast things.
You see, dear--" his voice faltered and his eyes grew anxious--"I must mind the shop.
That will be quite convenient to you, Mary Hopkins, won't it?" "Susy," said poor Mrs.
This girl was called Florence Archer.
Kathleen had given herself exactly the right length of time.
"I presume that you all like her?" Again the hands went up, and Kathleen's was raised the highest of all.
"Aren't you going to give me a little bit of dinner, Mrs.
Susy was small, rather stupid, and absolutely unimportant.
She found a seat on the front bench, dropped into it, and at the same moment encountered the almost malicious glance of Alice Tennant.
"No; I did not mean it as a slap at you or anybody.
She also felt excited and pleased and completely carried out of herself.
"She will ruin the boys in addition to all her other mischief.
Oh yes, it did--Give me your hand, Ruth.--That made my whole heart go out to Ruth.
As to you, darling, nothing will induce me to part with you until to-morrow morning." "But what will you do about school?" said Ruth.
"She is very clever," thought that young lady, "but she has tried that dodge on so often before that I am not going to be deceived by it now." Accordingly she went into her mother's room and stood by the window.
Let the ladies look after themselves.
"All day I have been so fretting that we were taking you out of your station; and that is a sad mistake--sad and terrible.
"Listen to me, all you girls, for I haven't too long in which to tell you; that horrid bell will ring us back to lessons and dullness in less than no time.
It's apologize to you she shall, and that before you leave this house.
"In a society like ours there are always rules which are not quite agreeable to every one.
END OF THE GREAT REBELLION.
"They're not quite such cads," she said under her breath.
Tennant," she said when she had finished, "what possessed you to live in England?
After a long pause, during which Alice once or twice felt the handle of the door again, the sound of her retreating footsteps was heard.
For a minute she pressed her hands against her face.
We don't know anything about London," interrupted Kathleen.
You hurt my feelings awfully this morning; you needn't hurt them again." "Very well," said Ruth.
She must work just as long as she likes.
How can you have grown up and kept well in a place like this?" "Opinions differ with regard to its dullness," said Alice.
She came to the door to greet Tom when he arrived, and called him in.
Through the ages we have been one, and now we have met in the flesh." "I think," said Cassandra, at last managing to get herself heard, "that you have said enough for the present, Miss O'Hara.
We of the foundation will lead our own life, and be as happy as the day is long.
"Will no girl present be brave enough to save the school?" Still there was silence.
She had hoped that he and she would go away to the old loft together, and talk as they had done the night before.
Work went on that morning with much verve and vigor.
Susy is a great friend of mine." Mrs.
it was a proud moment.
She is my Prime Minister.
I can't allow her to resign." "Oh, well," said Susy, "if you think of her in that way--" "Of course I think of her in that way, Susy.
Church, and she lives in a cottage about four miles from Merrifield.
She traced Kathleen's conduct from the first day of her arrival to the present hour.
"Oh, there you are!" she said.
"You are young, aren't you?
If mother came down" what wouldn't she say?
Tennant raised her head when she heard the door gently shut.
I have nothing to do; the lessons are deadly stupid.
On the morning after Ruth Craven had been admitted to the school Cassandra was one of the first arrivals.
The girls were directed to the right platform, and in process of time found themselves in the train.
I must not let him think that.
See if I don't do something for you.
They don't like to see a great overgrown girl like you in a class with little children; it does neither you nor the school credit.
She had a low forehead, rather nice curly hair, and a high color in her cheeks.
The music mistress was anxious that Kathleen should try for a musical scholarship, and she had some ideas of doing so herself.
Oh, I mustn't think of Michael now.
I must say it is horrid to be poor.
But of course you won't be.
And first and foremost, how do you like school?" "Not at all, aunty; and I'm not learning anything." "My dear, that is sad hearing; and your poor father pining his heart out for the want of you." "I never wished to go to school," said Kathleen.
What chance has one hundred against three?" "What is the good of bringing all that up, Susy?" said Mary Rand.
The Scholarship: Trouble Is Brewing 177 XVI.
I wish that you would believe that she hasn't.
Then of course it was not Alice she saw standing on the platform looking at her with reproachful, horrified eyes.
Forgive me, girls; you are all blameless;" and the next moment she had left the room.
It annoyed Kathleen; she found herself watching for it.
I love to see our old ladies gaily dressed.
Then she got into bed and fell asleep.
Susy rose and prepared supper, and at the crucial moment the new-laid egg was laid on Mrs.
"And is this the little lady--the dear little lady--- from over the seas, from the heart of Ireland itself?
I ain't at all a cruel woman.
The face appeared, the tongue now stuck into the cheek, one eye winking furiously.
"But," said Ruth, disentangling herself from Kathleen's embrace, "you don't mean that Miss Ravenscroft--Miss _Ravenscroft_--wanted you to go and see her and you didn't go?" "No, I didn't go.
"Mum's the word, ma'am," she said, and then she glanced round at her numerous companions.
However attached we may be to a person, we don't enter a strange house and snatch that person out of it.
"Mother is always grumbling," she said to herself; "and for that matter, so is Tom.
I can't bear to think of it--I can't bear to think of it." Susy's voice broke.
Tennant looked out, half expecting to see a mangled body on the ground; but there was no one in view.
"'I have only got one life,' he said, 'and I'd like to give it if necessary.'" "To tell the truth, Ruth, I could not understand him." "But I can," said Ruth.
You had best spend the afternoon with the old lady and encourage her all you can.
You have got to make yourself useful, and not to have ideas beyond your station." "Here are the sausages, granny," answered Ruth in a gentle tone.
"But forty's an awful age, isn't it?
"And Alice knew of this," she said to herself; "and when I didn't come to school this morning she thought that I was afraid.
"Yes," he said after a minute's pause.
"But nothing will happen," she cried, "if we are faithful to each other, stand shoulder to shoulder, and do not whatever happens, betray each other.
"I will tell you everything that concerns myself," she said.
This is going to be interesting, and you may be quite sure that if there is going to be a lark that I'm the one to help you, my colleen bawn." Kathleen and her aunt talked until late into the night, and when the young girl laid her head on her pillow she was lost immediately in profound slumber.
Susy poured out a cup of tea, drank it off at a gulp, snatched a piece of bread-and-butter from the plate, and sat down to prepare her lessons at another table.
I am an Irish girl, and the heritage of every Irish girl, handed down to her from a long line of ancestors, is to help the oppressed,' So now I am going to help all of you, and we are going to found this society, and we are going to have a good time." Kathleen's somewhat incoherent speech was received with shouts of applause.
I promised Miss Dove that I'd see you through your tasks.--You know, mother," continued Alice, "Kathleen is not very advanced for her age, and Miss Dove wants to get her into a proper class as quickly as possible; therefore she is to be coached a little, and I have undertaken to do it.--You will come with me, Kathleen?
You are living at the Tennants', are you not?
You mean kindly--no one more so--and so I have said to them." "But it will be a nice thing if my girl gets expelled owing to her," said a sour-faced woman, coming forward now and placing her arms akimbo just in front of Kathleen.
I will, and I can.
you seem to be just as much infatuated as the others.
"Perhaps you know," she said, fixing her beady black eyes upon Mrs.
Each house consisted of two stories, with a hall door in the middle and a sitting room on each side.
But the Wild Irish Girls--surely they were pining for her in the distance!
There is a girl in this school whom you all love and respect.
It was a dark-blue serge, very neatly made.
Kathleen looked up then, saw the anxiety in Mrs.
Put me on a horse, darling, and see what I can do; and put me in a boat, pet, and find out where I can take you.
She began to question Kathleen as to her acquirements, and found that she must leave her with the younger children for the time being.
I don't quite understand." "If you will kindly resume your story we shall be obliged, Miss Ravenscroft," said Miss Mackenzie.
I have not many opportunities to practice." "I live in the same terrace," said Miss Spicer eagerly, "and my piano is hardly ever used.
She tore it open, and gave a loud scream.
Kathleen sat bolt-upright in the centre of the class.
The little meeting broke up amidst universal applause.
Until then we hope that Ruth Craven will carefully consider her conduct, and be prepared to answer the very vital questions which will be put to her.--You can go, Ruth." Ruth left the room.
I am going to take you foundation girls up.
Tennant's.--Then if you, my dear lady, will put up with me until lunch-time, I can see more of my Kathleen, and propound some plans for your pleasure as well as hers.
She left Alice and ran towards Ruth.
"No, my boy, that I won't.
Now then, Kathleen, I will speak to you about the other matter which obliged me to send you a message last night." "Thank you, ma'am," said Kathleen.
She did not reproach Susy; that was not her way.
Hopkins was sure to encourage him to go to her, as she hoped against hope that when the old lady died Tom would be left some of her money.
Altogether her radiant dress and radiant face were quite sufficient to dazzle Tom.
"I went there for the first time to-day." "So your grandparents are going to educate you, miss, as if you were a lady." "I am a lady, Mrs.
"Shall I go at once and shoo the fowls?" "You had best give me my money first.
The Irish are always so terribly poor." "She is not poor at all.
Make up to her I will." She dashed, therefore, almost rudely through a great mass of incoming girls, and seized Ruth by her shoulder.
"This is cosy," she said.
"But how was it you came, Janey?
You know very well you mustn't be rude to Aunt Church.--Don't mind her, aunt; she is a very naughty girl." "I am not, mother," said Susy; "and it's awfully unkind of you to say it of me.
Immediately afterwards Kathleen dashed off to find Ruth.
They walked as much as possible on the grass, and glided in single file.
It was silly of you to hide in there; as if we minded." "But Kathleen, you ought to mind," said Susy; "for it would be the very last straw if we were discovered and there is a boy found amongst us.
It is too risky; and yet I think we'll do it," said Susy.
And she knew we weren't well off.
Tennant admitted that Kathleen's conduct was very bad.
I like you, and wish that I lived with you, and that you'd have Ruth Craven instead of your own daughter in the house.
"But this cook might, if a nice Irish girl, who has plenty of money, gave it to her.
She had a great deal of quick wit and ready perception.
I don't want the thing to be riotous, nor to do harm in any way.
Church, who would have given her niece unlimited time to return the money had there been a real, proper, bloodthirsty burglary, was not at all inclined to show mercy when the affair dwindled down into an unknown thief taking a small sum of money out of the till.
My grandfather and grandmother are very poor people; but my father was a gentleman, and my mother was a lady, and their great longing in life was to have me well educated.
She spoke gently, and then she added: "But there is only one piano at the Tennants', and that is in the drawing-room, and Alice or the boys or Mrs.
Her depression had now left her, and she felt excited, but at the same time irritated.
I have loved you ever since I came to the school.
I can't decide just now.
"It is from Aunt Katie O'Flynn, and she is crossing the Channel, the darling colleenoge.
Will you each come forward and accept the badge of membership?" Kathleen's badges were very much admired, the eager girls bending down towards the light of the lamps in order to examine them more thoroughly.
I mean to be terribly naughty all the afternoon.
The fact was, they did not begin to appear until soon after eight on Wednesday evenings.
"I was so distracted; I have to be a good way from here at nine o'clock, I couldn't think whatever kept you.
You are nothing but a little, under-bred Cockney." "Thank you, Aunt Church.
She had added a pound of sausage and a little piece of pork to their usual Sunday fare.
The Wild Irish Girl 26 IV.
The tea, in a pewter teapot, was weak; the milk was sky-blue, and the jug that held it was cracked.
"And we'll never betray you or one another." CHAPTER XXII.
"I didn't know I had such an enthusiastic following.
I have no real dislike to learning, and if another girl spoke to me as you have done I might be very glad." "What do you mean?" said poor Alice.
She went upstairs and selected from her heterogeneous wardrobe one of her very prettiest and most fashionable and most unsuitable dresses.
"You can sit down if you like," she said.
She rose as she spoke.
He was feeling rather poorly to-day.
"I am fond of Alice Tennant, and I am fond of Cassandra Weldon." "And I care for Lucy Sharp"; "And I am devoted to Amelia Dawson," said other members of the Cabinet.
Tom had a scrap of dinner and then ran off to see Aunt Church.
The color left her face.
"Do come, Kathleen," she said.
She reached the foot of the window in perfect safety, saw that the ivy looked precisely as it had looked when she climbed down it, and began her upward ascent.
And I will--Whisper, Susy!" Susy somewhat unwillingly bent forward.
You must go to her house; you must insist on seeing her, and you must find out and let me know what is wrong.
"And there is another thing," continued Alice, dropping into a chair by Kathleen's side.
I said about ten times to myself that I wouldn't come, but eleven times I said that I would; and the eleventh time conquered, and here I am.
She strongly objected to gay dress on the person of little Susy Hopkins; but, as she expressed it, she knew the quality.
I will tell you all I can, of course; but may I say good-bye now, for I have a good deal to do before dinner?" "You are not half as friendly as you used to be," said Florence, pouting.
She'd be almost pretty if she was nicely dressed.
Craven came in, looked at her proudly, wagged her head, and returned to the kitchen.
No talking," called the indignant voice of a form-room mistress.
She is such a queer old body; and the neighbors sometimes drop in on Sundays.
Please forgive me, but I am always very plain-spoken; I always tell the truth.
These she stuck on the dressing-table, and when she had made her little garret almost as bright as day she unfolded her pale-blue blouse.
"I will join you, Cassandra," she said.--"Kathleen, I told you this morning what my decision was." "And I hate you!" said Kathleen.
She is my mother's own sister, and such a darling.
It is a blessed relief to have two months of that debt wiped out, and I am very much obliged to you, child, and I will help you all I can." "You can't think how exciting it is, mother," said Susy.
I'm so excited I can scarcely think of anything else.
Which is the most wicked?
Very well, I will meet her.
"But indeed you are mistaken.
Come and have dinner with me to-night at the Métropole, and bring any friend you like." "What a lark!" thought Kathleen.
She's got into that school, and she's trying for a scholarship.
I must do something desperate, and if Alice opposes me I'll have to do something worse." "You are a clipper!" said David Tennant, smiling into her face.
come to the glass." Kathleen had opened a cardboard box, and out of it she took a black velvet bonnet with nodding plumes and a little pink strip of velvet fastened under the brim.
I should hate you to get into trouble.
"But won't you forgive her?
The provisions were stowed safely away in the bottom and covered over with a piece of old matting, and then Tom and Susy started off.
"Yes, here she is," cried a third, and Ruth came and stood at the edge of the patch of light.
I just spoke to her the first day I went to the school." "She has asked me too.
"I can't make them quite right," he said slowly.
"This is intolerable," thought Alice.
Presently she stooped down and whispered to this small girl: "I hate school; don't you?" "Y--es," was the timid reply.
You are going to take advantage of mother's offer?" "I can't help myself.
Come with me, won't you?" Ruth hesitated.
Oh, you have made a stain!
I don't think particularly well of you, Kathleen; your ways are not my ways, nor your ideas mine; but I don't think, bad as you are, that you would tell a lie.
