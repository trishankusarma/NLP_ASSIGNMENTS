Carmichael, when it was suggested that the little girl should go into another room.
"Take it and go home, Melchisedec!
Carrisford," she said; "but I have explanations to make.
God bless you!" She would go away, feeling quite comforted and a little warmer herself.
The slates spread out on either side of them and slanted down into the rain gutter-pipes.
Barrow, "and dear friends--and ruin." Miss Minchin lost her breath.
"And she is mine, not yours.
Then if there are stars, you can lie and try to count how many go into the patch.
There was the usual bright fire glowing in the grate, and the Indian gentleman was sitting before it.
"You are the cleverest girl I ever saw!" "Isn't it nice?" said Sara.
14 What Melchisedec Heard and Saw On this very afternoon, while Sara was out, a strange thing happened in the attic.
If Sara would not tell her where she lived, she would find out in some other way.
It was a square pincushion, made of not quite clean red flannel, and black pins had been stuck carefully into it to form the words, "Menny hapy returns." "Oh!" cried Sara, with a warm feeling in her heart.
"Sara Crewe looks wonderfully well," Miss Minchin remarked disapprovingly to her sister.
There has not been a fire in that grate for many a day," glancing at the rusty fireplace.
Suppose I make friends with you." How it is that animals understand things I do not know, but it is certain that they do understand.
She sat down on it for a few minutes and let her head drop in her hands.
She had seen things so like them in India.
These'll just STAY in yer stummick." "Well," hesitated Sara, "I don't think it would be good if they stayed always, but I do believe they will be satisfying." They were satisfying--and so were beef sandwiches, bought at a cook-shop--and so were rolls and Bologna sausage.
She flew at her and shook her.
"But I suppose there MIGHT be good in things, even if we don't see it.
But the sudden thought which had flashed upon her had made her over-sensitive.
"I do not want it." If she had cried and sobbed and seemed frightened, Miss Minchin might almost have had more patience with her.
"Well," she remarked, "I do not know whether your mamma would like you to tell stories to servant girls, but I know MY mamma wouldn't like ME to do it." "My mamma!" said Sara, looking odd.
When she looked up from her page she saw that Becky had heard the sound also, as she had turned her head to look and was listening rather nervously.
Sara had not looked toward it as she came in.
She was such a little girl that one did not expect to see such a look on her small face.
3 Ermengarde On that first morning, when Sara sat at Miss Minchin's side, aware that the whole schoolroom was devoting itself to observing her, she had noticed very soon one little girl, about her own age, who looked at her very hard with a pair of light, rather dull, blue eyes.
The school ought to be very fashionable now Miss Minchin has a princess for a pupil." Sara started toward her.
Take this book and look at it until he arrives." Sara's cheeks felt warm.
"And she is certainly left on your hands, ma'am--as she hasn't a relation in the world that we know of." Miss Minchin started forward.
He only eats the little bits.
I wish you to express your appreciation of it by saying aloud all together, 'Thank you, Sara!'" The entire schoolroom rose to its feet as it had done the morning Sara remembered so well.
She will be angry with me for letting you whisper." She had found out already that she was to be held accountable for everything which was objected to.
"All her life each day I know," answered Ram Dass.
CAN you?" Sara looked at her in simple surprise.
What CAN have happened?" Miss Minchin wasted no words.
They had been allowed to come in to perform this office because he had specially invited them.
Carmichael bowed slightly, and Miss Minchin looked from him to Mr.
"There doesn't seem to be much," she answered, half laughing.
I would help you with your lessons." "But you will not have to stay for a very long time, little Sara," he had always said.
He did not feel any particular sympathy for irate keepers of boarding schools.
"Now we will begin the party." She led the way to the table.
"It's too cold for monkeys to be out.
Some men laughed at me because my old shoes made me slip down in the mud.
On this particular afternoon she had been taking her dancing lesson, and the afternoon on which the dancing master appeared was rather a grand occasion at the seminary, though it occurred every week.
It is papa!" They all ran to the windows to look out.
She was always awkward, and the more she felt, the more stupid she was given to being.
When I told her what had happened, she just stood quite still and looked at me without making a sound.
"They've no right to starve her to death." When Sara went into the kitchen that morning the cook looked askance at her, and so did the housemaids; but she passed them hurriedly.
He was not an Indian gentleman really, but an Englishman who had lived in India.
Something seemed to be the matter with him.
She was taught nothing, and only after long and busy days spent in running here and there at everybody's orders was she grudgingly allowed to go into the deserted schoolroom, with a pile of old books, and study alone at night.
Carrisford has been searching for her for nearly two years; he has found her at last, and he will keep her." After which he asked Miss Minchin to sit down while he explained matters to her fully, and went into such detail as was necessary to make it quite clear to her that Sara's future was an assured one, and that what had seemed to be lost was to be restored to her tenfold; also, that she had in Mr.
"Couldn't you go to that place with me, papa?" she had asked when she was five years old.
It was a sense of light, and a sound--the sound of a crackling, roaring little fire.
First he went to the narrow bed.
And," opening large, convicting eyes, "it takes sixteen years to make you twenty." "Dear me," said Lavinia, "how we can calculate!" In fact, it was not to be denied that sixteen and four made twenty--and twenty was an age the most daring were scarcely bold enough to dream of.
There was, however, one place from which one could see all the splendor of them: the piles of red or gold clouds in the west; or the purple ones edged with dazzling brightness; or the little fleecy, floating ones, tinged with rose-color and looking like flights of pink doves scurrying across the blue in a great hurry if there was a wind.
She does not seem to wish to learn," said Miss Minchin.
"Me hear it?" she cried.
Perhaps there is a language which is not made of words and everything in the world understands it.
"Them pore princess ones that was drove into the world." Miss Minchin had never looked quite so still and hard as she did when Sara came to her, a few hours later, in response to a message she had sent her.
Nothing had been left in it but rubbish.
Among other things, a new doll had been ordered in Paris, and her wardrobe was to be, indeed, a marvel of splendid perfection.
I won't ask him anything.
"I am sorry to disturb Mr.
When she had lighted it, she bent forward and looked at Sara, with her new thought growing to definite fear in her eyes.
It was not on the slates, but on the stairs below, and it was Miss Minchin's angry voice.
She had been told to go into the schoolroom and study until ten o'clock, and she had become interested in her work, and remained over her books later.
I--don't--want--to--wake--up." Of course it was a dream.
"Only an Oriental could have planned it.
"She is a sensible little thing, and she never wants anything it isn't safe to give her," he said.
Miss Minchin's sitting room looked as it always did--all traces of the feast were gone, and Miss Minchin had resumed her usual dress.
When she drove or walked out, she used to look into shop windows eagerly.
"That's what I look at some people for.
In fact, she herself scarcely remembered anything but that she walked up and down, saying over and over again to herself in a voice which did not seem her own, "My papa is dead!
"Carmichael," the invalid gasped, "it is the child--the child!" For a moment Sara thought he was going to die.
Your mother COULDN'T be proud of you, and no one would dare to say you looked like any of your relations.
It used to seem as if she had all the sky and the world to herself.
There was a wreath of flowers on it.
She had known that she looked odd and shabby, but until now she had not known that she might be taken for a beggar.
She was correctly and well dressed, and rigidly polite.
"If you please, Miss Minchin," said Sara, suddenly, "mayn't Becky stay?" It was a bold thing to do.
Miss Minchin was as harsh and insulting as ever, Miss Amelia as peevish, and the servants were as vulgar and rude.
Consequently Ermengarde spent the greater part of her life in disgrace or in tears.
She felt as if she had never been quite so hungry before.
Sara hid her face in her arms.
"It might only have been lent to me for just that one awful night.
She carried the monkey in her arms, and he evidently did not intend to part from her, if it could be helped.
"I do not desire that it should be treated as one." So Sara was led grandly in and felt shy when, on her entry, the big girls stared at her and touched each other's elbows, and the little ones began to squirm joyously in their seats.
She brings back the monkey who had again run away to her attic under the roof.
Oh, I do like you!" She leaned back in her chair and reflected.
"I have only fourpence." "I'll throw in two for makeweight," said the woman with her good-natured look.
She saw that you were a hard-hearted, worldly woman, and that I was a weak fool, and that we were both of us vulgar and mean enough to grovel on our knees for her money, and behave ill to her because it was taken from her--though she behaved herself like a little princess even when she was a beggar.
"Suppose I had good shoes and a long, thick coat and merino stockings and a whole umbrella.
The Princess Sara--as she remembered her--stood at her very bedside, holding a candle in her hand.
"I can speak it because I have heard it all my life," she answered.
It arose in one of her moments of great desolateness.
They care for that more than for being thanked.
"You are aware, young ladies," the speech began--for it was a speech--"that dear Sara is eleven years old today." "DEAR Sara!" murmured Lavinia.
When he felt at last sure that he had found them and had gone to their house, he had been told that they were absent on a journey.
He did not know that they looked so because she was hungry for the warm, merry life his home held and his rosy face spoke of, and that she had a hungry wish to snatch him in her arms and kiss him.
It almost seemed for the moment to her narrow, unimaginative mind that there must be some real power hidden behind this candid daring.
The women in the kitchen were depressed, and that made them more ill-tempered than ever.
I seen a' idol bein' carried in for him to worship.
Even solicitors had no right to take liberties.
Something in the eagerness and timidity of the smudgy face made her look at it, and when she looked she smiled because it was her way to smile at people.
Suddenly--and it was all through the loving mournfulness of Becky's streaming eyes--her face looked more like a child's not so much too old for her years.
She had been brought to the seminary because Lady Meredith's two little girls had been educated there, and Captain Crewe had a great respect for Lady Meredith's experience.
It was not likely that it would be left to Miss Minchin.
But, upon my word, she seems as little subdued as if--as if she were a princess." "Do you remember," put in the unwise Miss Amelia, "what she said to you that day in the schoolroom about what you would do if you found out that she was--" "No, I don't," said Miss Minchin.
"Do you suppose," he said slowly, after a pause--"do you think it is possible that the other child--the child I never cease thinking of, I believe--could be--could POSSIBLY be reduced to any such condition as the poor little soul next door?" Mr.
"We are princesses, I believe.
She had two mattresses, two pillows, plenty of bed-covering, and every night a hot supper and a seat on the cushions by the fire.
"His God may lead her to him yet." Then they slipped through the skylight as noiselessly as they had entered it.
He stopped to listen with a palpitating heart.
Her French lesson was a pathetic thing.
"My word!" ejaculated Jessie, jogging Lavinia's elbow.
She's hungrier than I am." Ermengarde gasped.
"They always look as if they saw such a long way.
On his first arrival there, he had not been able satisfactorily to trace the family he had gone in search of.
Sara had bent over one of them with a delighted face.
It was too short and tight, and her slender legs looked long and thin, showing themselves from beneath the brief skirt.
He had a wife and a large family in the wall, and they had had frightfully bad luck for several days.
"If you will steal out of the room," said Sara, "I will stay with her." "Oh, Sara!" almost whimpered Miss Amelia.
It is her way to relate her visions to her secret friends.
I feel as if I were all the people in the story--one after the other.
The garret window next to theirs was shut because the house next door was empty.
He was a very nice, intelligent, middle-aged Frenchman, and he looked interested when his eyes fell upon Sara trying politely to seem absorbed in her little book of phrases.
An ordinary errand boy would not have been so clever and reliable.
How did you find it out?" "I got it out of Lottie.
Her mother had died when she was born, so she had never known or missed her.
"Whats'ever 'appens to you--whats'ever--you'd be a princess all the same--an' nothin' couldn't make you nothin' different." 8 In the Attic The first night she spent in her attic was a thing Sara never forgot.
He thought that her eyes looked hungry because she had perhaps had nothing to eat for a long time.
The first, it must be owned, was Becky--just Becky.
In a month's time he was, as Mr.
I am making him tame.
The child is neither truthful nor grateful.
"You ought to have known it," said she; "but children, unfortunately, never know what is best for them.
"When you talk about things," she said, "they seem as if they grew real.
YOU sent them!" "Yes, poor, dear child, I did," he answered her.
Sara's green-gray eyes looked very solemn and quite soft as she answered.
"Well, I never!" she exclaimed.
Very sorry the thing has happened, of course." "If you think she is to be foisted off on me, you are greatly mistaken," Miss Minchin gasped.
She called them the Montmorencys when she did not call them the Large Family.
Miss Minchin was not a clever woman, and in her excitement she was silly enough to make one desperate effort to regain what she could not help seeing she had lost through her worldly folly.
And she had given them pennies many a time.
This was certain scufflings and scratchings and squeakings in the walls and behind the skirting boards.
Miss Minchin had expected to see in Sara, when she appeared in the schoolroom, very much what Lavinia had expected to see.
"But you are clever in everything," she said in her approving way.
He's come to ask for his supper." Melchisedec had come out of his hole as if he had been listening for her footstep.
That meant that Ermengarde had managed to creep up to pay her a visit.
"How do I know?" snapped Lavinia.
It was like a sort of dream.
"I beg your pardon, sir, but there's not many young people that notices a hungry face in that way; and I've thought of it many a time.
Sara--who was only doing what she unconsciously liked better than anything else, Nature having made her for a giver--had not the least idea what she meant to poor Becky, and how wonderful a benefactor she seemed.
You shouldn't eat sweets,' and my uncle is always asking me things like, 'When did Edward the Third ascend the throne?' and, 'Who died of a surfeit of lampreys?'" Sara laughed.
He had shown a childlike pleasure and invention, and the preparations for the carrying out of the plan had filled many a day with interest which would otherwise have dragged wearily.
Upon the low table another supper stood--this time with cups and plates for Becky as well as herself; a piece of bright, heavy, strange embroidery covered the battered mantel, and on it some ornaments had been placed.
It cannot be done tonight." He lifted the covering and examined the one thin pillow.
She made it low because she was afraid it would tremble.
"Carmichael," he said to the father of the Large Family, after he had heard this description, "I wonder how many of the attics in this square are like that one, and how many wretched little servant girls sleep on such beds, while I toss on my down pillows, loaded and harassed by wealth that is, most of it--not mine." "My dear fellow," Mr.
"Go to your room this instant." Both Sara and Ermengarde heard the slap, and then heard Becky run in her slipshod shoes up the stairs and into her attic.
Then she put her eyeglass up, and gazed at her show pupil disturbedly.
"He is always in the library--reading things." "I love mine more than all the world ten times over," Sara said.
"I--I like yours." Miss St.
"She's a clever child, I believe.
Miss Minchin turns pale with rage when I do it, Miss Amelia looks frightened, and so do the girls.
Then he salaamed once more and got through the skylight and across the slates again with as much agility as the monkey himself had displayed.
"It is like a story!" "It IS a story," said Sara.
He was frightened to death.
They adopted her because she had been the favorite companion of their little daughter who died.
She did not know what would happen to it.
And here we are sitting by their fire--and--and--it's true!
"I thought--you see, everything is different now.
This was an incident which suggested strange things to her sordid mind.
"You heard me just now," she said.
It will come to you after a while.
"Is that there your best?" "It is one of my dancing-frocks," answered Sara.
The adopted parents apparently disappeared and left no trace." "But you say 'IF the child was the one I am in search of.
"He is a poor thing," said Janet, "and he says we cheer him up.
The stillness had only been broken by the pattering of the rain upon the slates and the skylight.
Sara managed to bore a hole in the sixpence and hung it on an old bit of narrow ribbon round her neck.
It does not belong to London fogs." They did not remain very long, to the great relief of Melchisedec, who, as he probably did not comprehend their conversation, felt their movements and whispers ominous.
"As to starving in the streets," he said, "she might have starved more comfortably there than in your attic." "Captain Crewe left her in my charge," Miss Minchin argued.
I have a friend." She took her candle and stole out of her own room and into Becky's, and stood by her bedside.
She talked to her small companions and hung about the elder girls and listened when they were gossiping; and acting upon certain information they had unconsciously let drop, she started late one afternoon on a voyage of discovery, climbing stairs she had never known the existence of, until she reached the attic floor.
This all meant that he was going to be separated from his beloved, quaint little comrade.
Becky had scarcely known what laughter was through all her poor, little hard-driven life.
"I wish it was over." Sara felt rather uncomfortable.
Don't open them, Sara." "I like them," Sara laughed, but she turned to the biggest box.
My two aunts are always saying, 'Dear me, Ermengarde!
I can jest see them big keys you say she carries.
"I will not put her down.
If she had been a self-opinionated, domineering child, she might have become disagreeable enough to be unbearable through being so much indulged and flattered.
It has a vaulted roof, and a minstrels' gallery, and a huge chimney filled with blazing oaken logs, and it is brilliant with waxen tapers twinkling on every side." "My eye, Miss Sara!" gasped Becky again.
A new idea will stop a crying child when nothing else will.
She knew that the news had penetrated the walls in some mysterious manner, and that every servant and every child would go to bed talking about it.
"It Is the Child" 18.
Lavinia could only invent one remark, and it fell rather flat.
Carmichael should go and see Miss Minchin himself.
It's soft!" she almost sobbed.
Emily is going to be my intimate friend." Captain Crewe looked at Miss Minchin and Miss Minchin looked at Captain Crewe.
It certainly seemed that there was no way in which any change could take place.
"To think that she was the girl with the diamond mines," Lavinia commented.
"Perhaps someone has left her a fortune," Jessie whispered.
"A beggar girl would never have said that," decided Janet.
"She was even hungrier than I was." "She was starving," said the woman.
"Put down your doll," said Miss Minchin.
"I was 'ungry enough, but 't warn't me--never!" "You deserve to be sent to prison," said Miss Minchin's voice.
She did not speak with rudeness so much as with a cold steadiness with which Miss Minchin felt it difficult to cope--perhaps because she knew she was doing a heartless and inhuman thing.
And suppose--suppose--just when I was near a baker's where they sold hot buns, I should find sixpence--which belonged to nobody.
The little ravening London savage was still snatching and devouring when she turned away.
She would be frightened if she found us here, and the Sahib Carrisford's plan would be spoiled." Ram Dass crossed noiselessly to the door and stood close to it.
His eyes look as if he was a person.
He spent money lavishly enough, that young man." Miss Minchin felt offended.
That moment she saw something and pounced upon it.
You need not go out on any more errands today." About half an hour afterward, when the schoolroom door opened and Sara walked in, the entire seminary was struck dumb.
He died in India." The haggard face contracted, and Ram Dass sprang to his master's side.
So the younger children adored Sara.
She tried to look as if she did not hear when Miss St.
If she is friendless and penniless, it is through my fault.
"And it keeps me from thinking too much." "I'm going to be quiet," Donald shouted.
Miss Minchin does not want me to talk to the girls.
Anyone who has not done this does not know what a different world they saw.
"Well," she said, with some fire, "I should like to slap YOU--but I don't want to slap you!" restraining herself.
Then she turned to leave the room.
"I was too proud to try and make friends.
Miss Amelia arranged the procession into decorum, and then, with Sara at her side heading it, she led it away, leaving the Last Doll sitting upon a chair with the glories of her wardrobe scattered about her; dresses and coats hung upon chair backs, piles of lace-frilled petticoats lying upon their seats.
"I'll go this minute!" She was in such haste that as she tiptoed out of the attic she dropped her red shawl and did not know it had fallen.
Was the row about that?
The sparrows come at her call.
It was a way of hers always to want to spring into any fray in which someone was made uncomfortable or unhappy.
She was a small thing and did not know what adversity meant, and was much bewildered by the alteration she saw in her young adopted mother.
"I'm sure that I remember you, miss," she said.
So she paused and looked.
"The little ones always remember what I tell them." "Sara," said Ermengarde, hope gleaming in her round face, "if you'll do that, and make me remember, I'll--I'll give you anything." "I don't want you to give me anything," said Sara.
I never saw either the child or her mother.
She talked and asked questions, and laughed until Becky's fears actually began to calm themselves, and she once or twice gathered boldness enough to ask a question or so herself, daring as she felt it to be.
But there were pictures and books in it, and curious things from India; there was a sofa and the low, soft chair; Emily sat in a chair of her own, with the air of a presiding goddess, and there was always a glowing fire and a polished grate.
To lie and kick and shriek, and find the only person near you not seeming to mind in the least, attracted her attention.
"If I go on talking and talking," she said, "and telling you things about pretending, I shall bear it better.
Red is a wonderfully kind and comfortable color.
"She is almost as big as Lottie," someone gasped.
"That's almost like telling lies," she said.
Poor plump Miss Amelia was trying first one method, and then another.
Could I do that?" "You shall do it tomorrow morning," said the Indian gentleman.
The mere fact of her sufferings and adventures made her a priceless possession.
"You will go to a nice house where there will be a lot of little girls, and you will play together, and I will send you plenty of books, and you will grow so fast that it will seem scarcely a year before you are big enough and clever enough to come back and take care of papa." She had liked to think of that.
Carrisford saw that she stood quietly, and showed none of the ordinary signs of child terror.
Sara was fond of amusing herself by trying to imagine the things hidden by the wall which divided the Select Seminary from the Indian gentleman's house.
Let us pretend it's a party!
It was his friend who took his money.
"Look at his face already." In fact, he did look changed.
His head was resting in his hand, and he looked as lonely and unhappy as ever.
"James, place the box on the table and remove the lid.
"Will he let me catch him?" she asked.
And it's ridiculous that she should look so grand, and be made so much of, in her rags and tatters!" "What were they doing when Miss Minchin caught them?" "Pretending some silly thing.
"But whatever happens," Sara kept saying to herself all day--"WHATEVER happens, somewhere in the world there is a heavenly kind person who is my friend--my friend.
And oh, won't you invite the prisoner in the next cell?" "Yes!
This was worse than anyone could have dreamed of its being.
And yet Sara had certainly been speaking TO someone.
Sara told it for the first time the day after she had been found.
There was nobody but Emily--no one in the world.
You have seen some of her clothes.
When the packages were unfolded Miss Minchin's countenance wore suddenly a singular expression.
Has she been sent away?
It always interested her to catch glimpses of rooms before the shutters were closed.
"My papa is dead!" It was not until long afterward that she realized that her bed had been so hard that she turned over and over in it to find a place to rest, that the darkness seemed more intense than any she had ever known, and that the wind howled over the roof among the chimneys like something which wailed aloud.
It was a wonderful moment.
I can always get a bit of bread the cook has thrown away, and it is quite enough to support him." "Is it the Bastille yet?" asked Ermengarde, eagerly.
"Do you think you can?" "I know I can," Sara answered.
And suppose"--as she drew the thin coverings over her--"suppose this was a beautiful soft bed, with fleecy blankets and large downy pillows.
She stands on the table there and looks out at the sky as if it spoke to her.
He has gone away." She put her head quietly down on her little, huddled-up knees, and sat very still for a few minutes.
"The child the Russian people adopted?" "She is not the child we are looking for," was Mr.
Ermengarde had an idea that if she had been like any other little girl, she might have suddenly burst out sobbing and crying.
"The Last Doll," she said.
"What are you crying for, Ermengarde?" she asked.
I am a working-woman myself and cannot afford to do much on my own account, and there's sights of trouble on every side; but, if you'll excuse me, I'm bound to say I've given away many a bit of bread since that wet afternoon, just along o' thinking of you--an' how wet an' cold you was, an' how hungry you looked; an' yet you gave away your hot buns as if you was a princess." The Indian gentleman smiled involuntarily at this, and Sara smiled a little, too, remembering what she had said to herself when she put the buns down on the ravenous child's ragged lap.
"Sara," she said in a timid, almost awe-stricken voice, "are--are--you never told me--I don't want to be rude, but--are YOU ever hungry?" It was too much just at that moment.
"Are you learning me by heart, little Sara?" he said, stroking her hair.
Her slender feet looked as they had done when Jessie had admired them, and the hair, whose heavy locks had made her look rather like a Shetland pony when it fell loose about her small, odd face, was tied back with a ribbon.
"I won't hurt you." He knew she would not hurt him.
The parents of Miss Crewe's fellow-pupils are not likely to refuse her invitations to visit her at her guardian's house.
Even proprietors of seminaries might make fortunes in stocks, with the aid of owners of mines.
She must finish her education.
It sounds like a story book." "Do you like it?" fluttered Ermengarde.
"Captain Crewe is dead," she said.
Come along, Lottie." And she marched out of the room, rather hoping that she might see the little servant again somewhere, but she found no trace of her when she got into the hall.
The friendly look in Sara's eyes was always very effective when people felt tired or dull.
She had known that she would be obliged to go also, and though sometimes her father's stories of the voyage and the new country had attracted her, she had been troubled by the thought that he could not stay with her.
"I do like you," Sara answered.
Lavinia had managed to pass Sara's room when the door was open, and had seen Mariette opening a box which had arrived late from some shop.
It was a big, dull, brick house, exactly like all the others in its row, but that on the front door there shone a brass plate on which was engraved in black letters: MISS MINCHIN, Select Seminary for Young Ladies.
"Miss Amelia!" she said to herself "How CAN it be!" And just at that very moment she heard the door being cautiously pushed open and saw Becky peeping round it.
"It was my rat." Ermengarde made one bound, and landed in the middle of the little dingy bed.
He had made wonderful preparations for her birthday.
From that afternoon Sara was regarded as a goddess and a queen by the entire alphabet class.
Sponge cake's a 'evenly thing, but it melts away like--if you understand, miss.
"Of course," said Sara, looking into her face as she held her on her knee, "of course papa, this is Emily." So Emily was bought and actually taken to a children's outfitter's shop and measured for a wardrobe as grand as Sara's own.
"I beg your pardon, monkey; but I'm glad you are not a baby.
"I want to go and see it." "You must not talk," said Sara.
There was such a sunset as this a few days after the Indian gentleman was brought to his new home; and, as it fortunately happened that the afternoon's work was done in the kitchen and nobody had ordered her to go anywhere or perform any task, Sara found it easier than usual to slip away and go upstairs.
"Shall I give him to the Lascar?" she asked.
"Oh!" cried Sara, softly, when she saw her.
"Then come," she said; "he is flying from side to side of the room as if he was frightened." Ram Dass slipped through his attic window and crossed to hers as steadily and lightly as if he had walked on roofs all his life.
Through the mysterious agency which works in schools and among servants, it was quite well known in the morning that Sara Crewe was in horrible disgrace, that Ermengarde was under punishment, and that Becky would have been packed out of the house before breakfast, but that a scullery maid could not be dispensed with at once.
On the night of the frustrated banquet Ram Dass had kept watch, all his packages being in readiness in the attic which was his own; and the person who was to help him had waited with him, as interested as himself in the odd adventure.
"Let us go and tell her.
The child is left a pauper.
During its passing she lived through a wild, unchildlike woe of which she never spoke to anyone about her.
"Chimneys--quite close to us--with smoke curling up in wreaths and clouds and going up into the sky--and sparrows hopping about and talking to each other just as if they were people--and other attic windows where heads may pop out any minute and you can wonder who they belong to.
It was her turn to be aghast.
But Sara did not laugh.
Oh, I do hope a nice head will look out of the attic window!" She would almost have liked to join the group of loiterers who had stopped on the pavement to watch the things carried in.
"He believed you were in school in France," Mrs.
A wooden box was covered with a rug, and some cushions lay on it, so that it wore quite the air of a sofa.
A dark face peered into the attic; then another face appeared behind it, and both looked in with signs of caution and interest.
He was weak and broken with long illness and trouble, but he looked at her with the look she remembered in her father's eyes--that look of loving her and wanting to take her in his arms.
Becky, who had heard it also, managed to creep up stairs earlier than usual.
"I have locked it," said a queer, polite little voice from inside.
"And yet--" "Yes," said Sara; "once you gave me six buns for fourpence, and--" "And you gave five of 'em to a beggar child," the woman broke in on her.
"Many's the time she's told me of it since--how she sat there in the wet, and felt as if a wolf was a-tearing at her poor young insides." "Oh, have you seen her since then?" exclaimed Sara.
"Sara," she said, "your papa's solicitor, Mr.
You ought to have been down earlier.
It is nicer than downstairs!" "Look at that sparrow," whispered Sara.
And when I look into it I seem to see Crewe's gay young face gazing back at me.
She choked down a sob as she pushed the attic door open, and then she broke into a low cry.
In a very short time she began to look less thin.
He suddenly broke loose, jumped on to the slates, ran across them chattering, and actually leaped on to Sara's shoulder, and from there down into her attic room.
"She's ridiculous without being rich," Lavinia sniffed.
Those howling mobs of people did not frighten her.
"And you"--to Ermengarde--"have brought your beautiful new books into this dirty attic.
"That girl has been listening," she said.
"I haven't--a bit--of mamma." "Yes, you have," said Sara, cheerfully.
I suppose"--to Sara--"that you feel now that you are a princess again." Sara looked down and flushed a little, because she thought her pet fancy might not be easy for strangers--even nice ones--to understand at first.
My mamma says that even big feet can be made to look small if you have a clever shoemaker.
Sometimes she had told them to her father, and he had liked them as much as she did.
"Ah, yes, your royal highness," she said.
When Miss Minchin came out and saw her, she looked rather annoyed.
When she reached the attic door and opened it, her heart gave a dreary little thump.
But, of course, it's not really likely that anyone but under servants would sleep there." One morning, on turning the corner of the square after a visit to the grocer's, the butcher's, and the baker's, she saw, to her great delight, that during her rather prolonged absence, a van full of furniture had stopped before the next house, the front doors were thrown open, and men in shirt sleeves were going in and out carrying heavy packages and pieces of furniture.
"Unless she has made friends with him because he has lived in India." "It would be just like her to thrust herself upon him and try to gain his sympathies in some such impertinent fashion," said Miss Minchin.
"Somehow, something always happens," she cried, "just before things get to the very worst.
"Here's the shawl," she cried.
The secretary, who was light and young, slipped through the skylight as noiselessly as Ram Dass had done; and he caught a last glimpse of Melchisedec's vanishing tail.
And he added aloud to Sara, "So you were sent up into the attic, and made into a little drudge.
He was his partner in certain large investments.
Ram Dass thanked Sara profoundly.
You are to be the attendant of missee sahib.
Whatsoever she meant, Ermengarde was sure it was something delightfully exciting.
You only think you are going to eat them.
If I am a princess in rags and tatters, I can be a princess inside.
Have you never pretended things?" "No," said Ermengarde.
Never were!" Miss Minchin actually got up from her chair.
Sara's comfortable sitting room seemed a bower of luxury to the scullery maid, though it was, in fact, merely a nice, bright little room.
She had never confessed that at times she was almost ravenous with hunger, as she was tonight.
"Don't mind me a bit, Becky!" cried Ermengarde.
She went and stood before his chair, with her hands clasped together against her breast.
"Oh, oh!" she cried woefully.
The wonders which had happened must be kept a secret, if such a thing were possible.
"What are you laughing at, you bold, impudent child?" Miss Minchin exclaimed.
Sometimes she had a rather stern little voice.
"You don't know how glad we are that you are found." Donald stood with his hands in his pockets, and gazed at Sara with reflecting and self-reproachful eyes.
When the day arrived the whole house was in a whirl of excitement.
"Here are the things," she said.
It was just then that Miss Minchin entered the room.
You never had a heart.
"Sometimes it's the loneliest place in the world." She was sitting in this way when her attention was attracted by a slight sound near her.
Go home, Melchisedec, and tell your wife there was nothing in my pocket.
There had grown in her mind rather a strange feeling about Emily, who always sat and looked on at everything.
"Young ladies," she said, "I wish to introduce you to your new companion." All the little girls rose in their places, and Sara rose also.
She made up a story of which Becky was the ill-used heroine.
"Is this a new pupil for me, madame?" he said to Miss Minchin.
At least, since the days when she had been a princess, Sara had never looked as she did now.
"Don't please her by staring at her in that way, you silly thing." "Sara," broke in Miss Minchin's deep voice, "come and sit here." And while the whole schoolroom stared and pushed with elbows, and scarcely made any effort to conceal its excited curiosity, Sara went to her old seat of honor, and bent her head over her books.
"I'm blest if she shouldn't have had a dozen." Then she turned to the child.
Carrisford had brain fever and ran away, and HE almost died.
That, however, was all she knew about it.
"I sleep in the attic, next to the scullery maid," she said.
You don't come to tell me that Captain Crewe is--" "He's dead, ma'am," Mr.
"There was no money; I belong to nobody." "How did your father lose his money?" the Indian gentleman broke in breathlessly.
"They belong to me," answered Sara, quietly.
"A banquet hall," said Sara.
I shall miss him myself--even though he doesn't know I am alive." When the door opened she moved away--remembering the sixpence--but she saw the traveler come out and stand against the background of the warmly-lighted hall, the older children still hovering about him.
"She's going to make a speech," whispered one of the girls.
And I was thinking that if I were one, you would never dare to do it, whatever I said or did.
See, you can scarcely stand up at this end of the room; and when the morning begins to come I can lie in bed and look right up into the sky through that flat window in the roof.
You have the nicest eyes I ever saw--but I wish you could speak." She was a child full of imaginings and whimsical thoughts, and one of her fancies was that there would be a great deal of comfort in even pretending that Emily was alive and really heard and understood.
"My aunt sent me the hamper.
One of Miss Minchin's chief secret annoyances was that she did not speak French herself, and was desirous of concealing the irritating fact.
She will begin howling about something in five minutes." It happened that Lottie had been seized with a sudden desire to play in the schoolroom, and had begged her adopted parent to come with her.
These are the richly embroidered napkins.
The absurd old feathers on her forlorn hat were more draggled and absurd than ever, and her downtrodden shoes were so wet that they could not hold any more water.
"Yes, yes, it must be.
"Pretend you are a princess now and this is a royal feast." "But it's your feast," said Sara; "you must be the princess, and we will be your maids of honor." "Oh, I can't," said Ermengarde.
"Those at a penny each." The woman went to the window and put some in a paper bag.
"I don't know what it may be worth.
The look in her eyes was exactly the look which Miss Minchin most disliked.
I know I look like a street beggar." "No, you don't--you don't!" Ermengarde broke in.
From a friend." When she saw that--wasn't it a strange thing for her to do--she put her face down upon the page and burst into tears.
Something was forcing her to awaken--something in the room.
She could scarcely stand still, but she dared not move until Miss Minchin had gone down the stairs and all was still.
"Miss Amelia has gone out to spend the night with her old aunt," she explained.
They can float anywhere they like.
Not only Sara, but the entire school, found it exciting, and made it the chief subject of conversation for weeks after it occurred.
Ram Dass had been lying flat upon the slates, looking in at the skylight, when the banquet had come to its disastrous conclusion; he had been sure of the profoundness of Sara's wearied sleep; and then, with a dark lantern, he had crept into the room, while his companion remained outside and handed the things to him.
When I had finished, she still stood staring for a few seconds, and then her chin began to shake, and she turned round and ran out of the room and upstairs.
The fact was that Miss Minchin's pupils were a set of dull, matter-of-fact young people.
She knew she need not hesitate to use the little piece of money.
Melchisedec's, and one is Melchisedec's own." Ermengarde began to laugh.
She wants Ermengarde to be one, too, but Ermengarde says she is too fat." "She IS too fat," said Lavinia.
The climate of India was very bad for children, and as soon as possible they were sent away from it--generally to England and to school.
She had wished very much that some one would take the empty house next door.
He wrote down things about the floor, the fireplace, the broken footstool, the old table, the walls--which last he touched with his hand again and again, seeming much pleased when he found that a number of old nails had been driven in various places.
And now, instead of looking forward to gains, she was left to look back upon losses.
If the other bearer passes to me the things through the window, I can do all and she will not stir.
And so when the servants, taking their tone from their mistress, were insolent and ordered her about, she would hold her head erect and reply to them with a quaint civility which often made them stare at her.
"Yes, you must take it, poor little girl!" he insisted stoutly.
She did not like to own to herself that her only companion could feel and hear nothing.
The meat pie had been intended for her special late supper.
Sara gave her a little nod, and the child, after another stare--a curious lingering stare--jerked her shaggy head in response, and until Sara was out of sight she did not take another bite or even finish the one she had begun.
They were expected to keep order, and there was danger that if they did not, Miss Minchin or Miss Amelia would appear and put an end to festivities.
"You are nothing but a DOLL!" she cried.
He was to sail away the next morning.
One crumb was very much larger than the others--in fact, it could scarcely be called a crumb.
It made her kneel down by him, just as she used to kneel by her father when they were the dearest friends and lovers in the world.
He was really not at all resigned himself, though he knew he must keep that a secret.
It began to make the room look furnished directly.
Sara saw her, and went and picked her up with trembling hands.
Perhaps Emily is more like me than I am like myself.
When Sara sat in silence and looked into the coals with dreaming eyes it generally meant that she was making a new story.
Carrisford about the encounter with the little-girl-who-was-not-a-beggar.
It spoils it if I think people listen." They had reached the passage leading to Sara's room by this time, and Ermengarde stopped short, staring, and quite losing her breath.
"The child is the little friend of all things, Sahib," he answered.
I have come here as a matter of duty.
On the contrary, there was a good deal of excitement going on.
The child was a clever child and a good child--and she would have paid you for any kindness you had shown her.
You mustn't cry!" she said.
"That is not your room now," Miss Amelia answered, reddening a little.
The last spark had died out of the paper in the grate and left only black tinder; the table was left bare, the golden plates and richly embroidered napkins, and the garlands were transformed again into old handkerchiefs, scraps of red and white paper, and discarded artificial flowers all scattered on the floor; the minstrels in the minstrel gallery had stolen away, and the viols and bassoons were still.
Several pieces of furniture had been set out of the van upon the pavement.
Then they went in and shut the door.
During her short life only one thing had troubled her, and that thing was "the place" she was to be taken to some day.
It was the Princess Sara indeed.
"What did she say?" inquired the woman.
She burst into fresh tears.
She sat and watched him without making any movement.
Sara bent and picked her up.
"I am sorry you do not like the idea of learning French." "I am very fond of it," answered Sara, thinking she would try again; "but--" "You must not say 'but' when you are told to do things," said Miss Minchin.
The attic had been very still all the day after Sara had left it in the early morning.
It was only sad and quiet.
"And it is not a big one, either.
Lottie had been sliding across the schoolroom floor, and, having first irritated Lavinia and Jessie by making a noise, had ended by falling down and hurting her fat knee.
"Missee sahib remembered," he said.
She sprang up, touched the table, the dishes, the rug; she went to the bed and touched the blankets.
Will he come?" she whispered.
No one will remember you.
She was probably determined to brave the matter out.
Please let me say just these words.
Sara stood near her father and listened while he and Miss Minchin talked.
"You must promise not to be frightened--not to scream the least bit, or I can't tell you," she answered.
He's had a lot of trouble, an' it's made him ill an' low in his mind.
"It was the day the dream came true." Then she told him the story of the bun shop, and the fourpence she picked up out of the sloppy mud, and the child who was hungrier than herself.
"At least I believe she can.
"And I was supposing a kind of plan," she said, when she had finished.
She stood still, and her green-gray eyes met his wonderingly.
"Cook tells me she has missed things repeatedly." "'T warn't me, mum," said Becky sobbing.
"I knew she was listening," she said.
"I am so glad," Sara said.
"We must pretend there is one!" Her eye swept the bare boards with a swift glance of admiration.
"Are there RATS there?" "Lots of 'em, miss," Becky answered in quite a matter-of-fact manner.
A Little Princess by Frances Hodgson Burnett A LITTLE PRINCESS Summary: Sara Crewe, a pupil at Miss Minchin's London school, is left in poverty when her father dies, but is later rescued by a mysterious benefactor.
I--I can't help making up things.
"But I'll go and ask the baker woman if she has lost anything," she said to herself, rather faintly.
I have asked that she remain.
One of the Populace 14.
My papa had a beautiful one, and he did not worship it." But Becky was rather inclined to prefer to believe that the new neighbor was "an 'eathen." It sounded so much more romantic than that he should merely be the ordinary kind of gentleman who went to church with a prayer book.
Ermengarde answered them slowly as if she were half plunged out into what, at the moment, seemed the most important and self-explaining thing.
"She's in my sitting room at this moment, dressed in silk gauze and lace petticoats, giving a party at my expense." "She's giving it at your expense, madam, if she's giving it," said Mr.
"It's stopping before the door.
He was a solitary man with no family at all, and it was evident that he was shattered in health and unhappy in mind.
"That is what a real princess does when the populace applauds her.
Ram Dass poured out drops from a bottle, and held them to his lips.
"She is hungrier than I am," she said to herself.
She hoped she should see her again, but though she caught sight of her carrying things up or down stairs on several occasions, she always seemed in such a hurry and so afraid of being seen that it was impossible to speak to her.
She called it the Large Family not because the members of it were big--for, indeed, most of them were little--but because there were so many of them.
I saw it when she sat down." "She has silk stockings on!" whispered Jessie, bending over her geography also.
"Oh, Becky!" she cried out, with a queer little laugh, "I love you, Becky--I do, I do!" "Oh, miss!" breathed Becky.
Some un'd be down on us if I did.
He could not understand how a child of his could be a notably and unmistakably dull creature who never shone in anything.
They ses to each other, 'That's the princess.' She was a growed-up young lady, but she was pink all over--gownd an' cloak, an' flowers an' all.
We are both old enough to know better." Here was Lavinia's opportunity.
"She's dressed for the theater," said Lavinia.
She realized that her voice, as heard from inside the room, could not have sounded either dignified or amiable.
Presently, she lifted her face and shook back her black locks, with a queer little smile.
Sara never made any mischief herself, or interfered with anyone.
"To eat, miss?" she said.
Miss Minchin's opinion was that if a child were continually praised and never forbidden to do what she liked, she would be sure to be fond of the place where she was so treated.
She did not even mind when Miss Minchin cleared her throat ominously and spoke again.
"Lavinia and Jessie are 'best friends,'" she said rather huskily.
It sounded as if something was on the slates--something that dragged softly." "What could it be?" said Ermengarde.
"I will beg your pardon for laughing, if it was rude," she said then; "but I won't beg your pardon for thinking." "What were you thinking?" demanded Miss Minchin.
I have adopted him for a friend.
It's so different to be a sparrow.
And that makes it seem as if it were true.
John, and kept glancing toward her through the morning.
And little children run about in the lily fields and gather armfuls of them, and laugh and make little wreaths.
_I_ tried to when I was makin' it.
You can't sneer back at people like that--if you are a princess.
"If we light it, there will be a bright blaze for a few minutes, and we shall feel as if it was a real fire." She struck a match and lighted it up with a great specious glow which illuminated the room.
Sara seemed as much unlike her as if she were a creature from another world.
One or two of them had even caught a glimpse of her French maid, Mariette, who had arrived the evening before.
So she crossed the pavement and put her wet foot on the step.
"Do you know where she is?" "Yes, I do," answered the woman, smiling more good-naturedly than ever.
But she knew she should find something.
I'm so hungry now that I could almost eat you.
"Oh, if you please, miss!
"And--I am much happier--and I have come to ask you to do something for me." "Me, miss!" exclaimed the bun-woman, smiling cheerfully.
Carmichael had prophesied he would be, a new man.
She often found them long and steep when she was tired; but tonight it seemed as if she would never reach the top.
"Don't stand there staring at them.
"How many?" "Five." The woman thought it over.
They would have to be little ones, but they could be beautiful; and there could be a lamp with a deep rose-colored shade; and a table in the middle, with things to have tea with; and a little fat copper kettle singing on the hob; and the bed could be quite different.
You are inside my heart." And they put their arms round each other and kissed as if they would never let each other go.
"Did you see," said Janet to Nora, as they went back to the room--"the little-girl-who-is-not-a-beggar was passing?
Instead of being a sort of small royal personage among them, she no longer seemed to be one of their number at all.
The vision she related told what this miserable room might be if it had comforts in it.
"That's all you'll get at this time of day." Sara went and found the bread.
And he would never say a word--not one word." Ermengarde could only gaze at her, but she felt that she was beginning to adore her.
Something was written on the flyleaf--just a few words, and they were these: "To the little girl in the attic.
I'll just tell you what things are.
She seemed to rejoice when it was devoured in hungry bites.
If you suppose anything hard enough it seems as if it were real." "It's all very well to suppose things if you have everything," said Lavinia.
She felt it dangling over her ear, and tried wildly to put it straight.
She was filled with something approaching reverence for everything Sara did and said.
She was reading one of her new books to Becky just before they went to their respective beds, when her attention was attracted by a sound at the skylight.
Sara got up from the floor and answered quite dramatically: "It is the prisoner in the next cell." "Becky!" cried Ermengarde, enraptured.
"Whatever comes," she said, "cannot alter one thing.
She is all I have.
"I told you we were just the same--only two little girls--just two little girls.
"I feel as if I do not want to lose sight of her." "I will take care of her," Janet said, "and mamma will come in a few minutes." And it was Janet who led her away.
"Oh, Sara!" she exclaimed, endeavoring to produce a suitable smile.
"If he wants to keep himself a secret, it would be rude to try and find out who he is.
I know I can teach them.
"Sometimes I can and sometimes I can't," she said stoutly.
I'll pretend that to do things people like is scattering largess.
She did not care very much for other little girls, but if she had plenty of books she could console herself.
A man of that sort might prefer to overlook his young relation's welfare at a distance.
"Yes," answered poor, silly Miss Amelia.
"I can't bear this," said the poor child, trembling.
When it did come, she was so sorry that she put up her lip ominously.
Perhaps you would like to do it because you know what it is to be hungry, too." "Yes, miss," said the girl.
If she had been an indolent child, she would have learned nothing.
It must be remembered that she had been very deeply absorbed in the book about the Bastille, and she had had to recall several things rapidly when she realized that she must go and take care of her adopted child.
Her trick of pretending things was the joy of her life.
The clouds hung low over the skylight and were either gray or mud-color, or dropping heavy rain.
Go home at once." The Indian gentleman drew Sara to his side and patted her hand.
Carmichael appeared, calling Sara to him with a gesture.
"I know I hadn't ought to.
"Why, bless me!" she said again when she had heard it all; "it'll be a pleasure to me to do it.
"Listen; the two knocks meant, 'Prisoner, are you there?'" She knocked three times on the wall herself, as if in answer.
I know when she is alone until midnight, learning from her books; I know when her secret friends steal to her and she is happier--as children can be, even in the midst of poverty--because they come and she may laugh and talk with them in whispers.
"He wants you to know what is in them," said Sara.
One was Ram Dass and the other was a young man who was the Indian gentleman's secretary; but of course Melchisedec did not know this.
So until almost midnight the entire seminary, realizing somehow that all rules were laid aside, crowded round Ermengarde in the schoolroom and heard read and re-read the letter containing a story which was quite as wonderful as any Sara herself had ever invented, and which had the amazing charm of having happened to Sara herself and the mystic Indian gentleman in the very next house.
"You darling Becky, you made it all yourself." Becky gave a hysteric but joyful sniff, and her eyes looked quite moist with delight.
"When I was first taken there by my papa." "Where is your papa?" "He died," said Sara, very quietly.
It was better than to go into the room alone and find it empty and desolate.
I'll just wait a few minutes." She took a seat on the edge of the table, and sat swinging her slim, rose-colored legs, and wondering what it would be best to do.
But she is not a beggar, however shabby she looks." And afterward she was called by all of them, "The-little-girl-who-is-not-a-beggar," which was, of course, rather a long name, and sounded very funny sometimes when the youngest ones said it in a hurry.
Barrow was a shrewd businessman, and felt it as well to make his own freedom from responsibility quite clear without any delay.
"Sara," she said, "do you think you can bear living here?" Sara looked round also.
"Do you want to buy something?" she added, as she saw Sara glance at the buns.
And she was looking at her steadily and as if she was merely thinking.
"A lot of nice accidents have happened to me.
She felt as if warm, delightful bedclothes were heaped upon her.
She plays it all the time--even in school.
Scullery maids were machines who carried coal scuttles and made fires.
She was really the better-natured person of the two, but she never disobeyed Miss Minchin.
When her older sister looked and spoke as she had done just now, the wisest course to pursue was to obey orders without any comment.
I can't SAY the words.
A happy, beautifully cared for little girl naturally attracts attention.
You say 'if.' We are not sure.
"Ermengarde would never have thought of such a thing.
And whoever it is--wherever they are--I have a friend, Becky--someone is my friend." It cannot be denied that as they sat before the blazing fire, and ate the nourishing, comfortable food, they felt a kind of rapturous awe, and looked into each other's eyes with something like doubt.
She straightened her thin little body and lifted her head.
'If you please, cook'; 'Will you be so kind, cook?' 'I beg your pardon, cook'; 'May I trouble you, cook?' She drops 'em about the kitchen as if they was nothing." The morning after the interview with Ram Dass and his monkey, Sara was in the schoolroom with her small pupils.
Sara had paused in the hall, wondering if she ought to go into the room, because she had recently begun a friendly acquaintance with Lottie and might be able to quiet her.
Remember that." Carrisford dropped his forehead in his hands.
Her strongest weapon was that in some mysterious way she had found out that a very small girl who had lost her mother was a person who ought to be pitied and made much of.
Perhaps, if I was not feverish I should not be awake, tossing about, one half of the night and spend the other half in troublesome dreams.
"A princess must be polite," she said to herself.
He was carried up the steps, and the head of the Large Family went with him, looking very anxious.
But, really, while the night was passing she scarcely knew that she had a body at all or remembered any other thing than one.
As she went out of the room, Becky turned upon the threshold and looked about her with devouring eyes.
There were places where it seemed that one could run or climb or stand and wait to see what next was coming--until, perhaps, as it all melted, one could float away.
"Are you going to let him in, miss?" she said.
She had been told that her mamma had wings and a crown, and she had been shown pictures of ladies in beautiful white nightgowns, who were said to be angels.
John called "le bon pain," "lee bong pang." She had a fine, hot little temper of her own, and it made her feel rather savage when she heard the titters and saw the poor, stupid, distressed child's face.
"And as if I want to hit back.
Did he make the dream that came true?" "Yes, my dear--yes!
Someone was coming up the stairs.
He always became excited when his still weakened brain was stirred by memories of the catastrophes of the past.
She had heard it said very often that she was "clever," and she wondered if she was--and IF she was, how it had happened.
"With the Princess Sara at the head of the table." She turned fiercely on Sara.
"How nice a red rug would look on the floor!" exclaimed Sara.
He shuffled resignedly, if not contentedly, back to his home.
The first thing she thought was that his dark face looked sorrowful and homesick.
Her small pupils loved her, and strove with each other for the privilege of standing close to her and insinuating their small hands into hers.
My noble father, the king, who is absent on a long journey, has commanded me to feast you." She turned her head slightly toward the corner of the room.
"Sahib," he said, "the child herself has come--the child the sahib felt pity for.
"Don't cry and make a noise," she implored.
Are you sure it was Paris?" "My dear fellow," broke forth Carrisford, with restless bitterness, "I am SURE of nothing.
It was evident that a journey was to be taken, and it was Mr.
It seems more real than you are--more real than the schoolroom.
The monkey was a good monkey and would not bite; but, unfortunately, he was difficult to catch.
Miss Minchin's voice was almost fierce when she answered: "Where is Sara Crewe?" Miss Amelia was bewildered.
"Help me to find her.
"Will Moscow be covered with snow?" said the little girl Janet.
Carmichael stopped her with polite firmness.
So Sara told her, and because her Magic helped her she made her ALMOST see it all: the golden platters--the vaulted spaces--the blazing logs--the twinkling waxen tapers.
Not that I care, but it's rather vulgar of her to share with servant girls in attics.
I don't know why it is.
He would write to Sara twice a week, and she was to be given every pleasure she asked for.
"I don't know, I'm sure, sister," answered Miss Amelia.
Then if she heard either of us coming, she would just run back and jump into her chair and pretend she had been there all the time." "Comme elle est drole!" Mariette said to herself, and when she went downstairs she told the head housemaid about it.
She felt as if she had been outraged and robbed, and that Captain Crewe and Sara and Mr.
She tried to begin a smile, and somehow she could not.
She had seen that his quick native eyes had taken in at a glance all the bare shabbiness of the room, but he spoke to her as if he were speaking to the little daughter of a rajah, and pretended that he observed nothing.
"I Tried Not to Be" 19.
She shed a good many tears, and mopped her eyes a good deal.
When Miss Minchin talked about money, she felt somehow that she always hated her--and, of course, it was disrespectful to hate grown-up people.
Then Sara suddenly turned the handle, and threw it wide open.
"So you are Miss Minchin?" he said.
Miss Minchin, in her grandest silk dress, led her by the hand.
He could have told any number of stories if he had been able to speak anything but Hindustani.
"Sometimes I try to pretend it is another kind of place; but the Bastille is generally easiest--particularly when it is cold." Just at that moment Ermengarde almost jumped off the bed, she was so startled by a sound she heard.
Her accent is exquisite." "You ought to have told me," exclaimed Miss Minchin, much mortified, turning to Sara.
Two men were outside on the roof, and were making silent preparations to enter through the skylight itself.
Sara tells me when she puts me to bed." "You wicked thing," said Lavinia, turning on Sara; "making fairy stories about heaven." "There are much more splendid stories in Revelation," returned Sara.
"The diamond mines alone--" Mr.
It seemed only likely that she would be there." "Yes," Mr.
But she did not look up.
"Are you making something up in your head, miss?" Becky inquired with respectful softness.
One of these nights, when she came up to the attic cold and hungry, with a tempest raging in her young breast, Emily's stare seemed so vacant, her sawdust legs and arms so inexpressive, that Sara lost all control over herself.
He was disobedient, though not evil.
"Excuse me," he said; "she will see anyone she wishes to see.
I tell you that you are quite alone in the world, and have no one to do anything for you, unless I choose to keep you here out of charity." "I understand," answered Sara, in a low tone; and there was a sound as if she had gulped down something which rose in her throat.
"He wouldn't have given me his Christmas sixpence if I hadn't looked as if I needed it." Somehow the sight of the dear little sixpence was good for both of them.
"If I can only keep on thinking it," she cried, "I don't care!
She was staring straight before her with a stupid look of suffering, and Sara saw her suddenly draw the back of her roughened black hand across her eyes to rub away the tears which seemed to have surprised her by forcing their way from under her lids.
"Oh, don't send her away," she sobbed.
Her black hair was spread out on the pillow and Emily's golden-brown hair mingled with it, both of them had lace-ruffled nightgowns, and both had long eyelashes which lay and curled up on their cheeks.
She looked as if she was going to open the door and rush out of the room to stop the festivities going on joyfully and rather noisily that moment over the refreshments.
It was as if she scarcely heard the rude and acid things said to her; or, if she heard them, did not care for them at all.
You gets used to the noise they makes scuttling about.
"I don't know how I dare," Miss Amelia answered, with a kind of reckless courage; "but now I've begun I may as well finish, whatever happens to me.
But it mightn't be easy." She often thought afterward how strange it was that just as she had finished saying this--just at that very moment--Miss Amelia came into the room.
The truth was, however, that it was a sound which had called her back--a real sound--the click of the skylight as it fell in closing after a lithe white figure which slipped through it and crouched down close by upon the slates of the roof--just near enough to see what happened in the attic, but not near enough to be seen.
Sara went to her politely.
"He has died without a penny.
All her valuable garments had been disposed of, and such as had been left for her use she was expected to wear so long as she could put them on at all.
"And I never knew!" "I didn't want you to know," Sara said.
"You could speak it if you had always heard it." "Oh, no, I couldn't," said Ermengarde.
And then I will wash your face and brush your hair." To which Lottie agreed quite cheerfully, and trotted out of the room and upstairs with her, without seeming even to remember that the whole of the last hour's tragedy had been caused by the fact that she had refused to be washed and brushed for lunch and Miss Minchin had been called in to use her majestic authority.
"As hard as a stone," he said.
They could never be quite sure when Sara would be there, and they could scarcely ever be certain that Miss Amelia would not make a tour of inspection through the bedrooms after the pupils were supposed to be asleep.
Has she a black one?" Miss Amelia began to turn pale.
Carmichael, was just on the point of going to see you." Mr.
A deep, rich yellow light filled the air; the birds flying across the tops of the houses showed quite black against it.
The Indian gentleman took hold of her hand quickly.
Sometimes"--reflectively--"I've thought perhaps I might do something wicked--I might suddenly fly into a rage and kill Miss Minchin, you know, when she was ill-treating me--but I COULDN'T be vulgar.
One of the things Miss Minchin had taken from her was a carved teakwood desk her father had sent her.
They jumped down from the window-seat together, and went upstairs.
But I do so want him to know how thankful I am to him--and how happy he has made me.
SUPPOSE if I did, I should go into the shop and buy six of the hottest buns and eat them all without stopping." Some very odd things happen in this world sometimes.
When she reached the top of the stairs, she was surprised to see a glimmer of light coming from under the attic door.
No one but Sara could have done it.
"Upon my word," he said faintly to Mr.
She had no one to talk to; and when she was sent out on errands and walked through the streets, a forlorn little figure carrying a basket or a parcel, trying to hold her hat on when the wind was blowing, and feeling the water soak through her shoes when it was raining, she felt as if the crowds hurrying past her made her loneliness greater.
When she sat or stood in the midst of a circle and began to invent wonderful things, her green eyes grew big and shining, her cheeks flushed, and, without knowing that she was doing it, she began to act and made what she told lovely or alarming by the raising or dropping of her voice, the bend and sway of her slim body, and the dramatic movement of her hands.
"Doesn't it LOOK real?" she said.
She grew fonder and fonder of Becky, and she used to look forward to the two mornings a week when she went into the schoolroom to give the little ones their French lesson.
When you will not fly into a passion people know you are stronger than they are, because you are strong enough to hold in your rage, and they are not, and they say stupid things they wish they hadn't said afterward.
It just happened that I was born with a father who was beautiful and nice and clever, and could give me everything I liked.
The fact was, she was too clever for you, and you always disliked her for that reason.
But Miss Minchin would be cross if she found out.
"Her going out I know, and her coming in; her sadness and her poor joys; her coldness and her hunger.
Carrisford laughed and patted her shoulder again.
I could have entered this room in the night many times, and without causing her to turn upon her pillow.
The last sentences had recalled something to her troubled mind and given her a sudden inspiration.
"May I have something to eat?" Sara asked rather faintly.
"Why, it was you who were different!" she cried.
"Let us go very quietly to the door," she whispered, "and then I will open it quite suddenly; perhaps we may catch her." She was half laughing, but there was a touch of mysterious hope in her eyes which fascinated Ermengarde, though she had not the remotest idea what it meant, or whom it was she wanted to "catch," or why she wanted to catch her.
She looked frightful in her wet and dirty rags.
They are ready." The Indian gentleman's secretary stood still and looked round him as he thrust his tablets back into his pocket.
"Let us sit down," said Sara, "and I will tell you.
He got out of his bed in the middle of that night and went and stood looking down at Sara, who lay asleep with Emily in her arms.
She sat and talked long that night of what he would be like, of what his wife would be like if he had one, and of what his children would be like if they had children.
She was inordinately jealous of Sara.
Oh, the Magic was GOOD to me!" If it was possible for weather to be worse than it had been the day before, it was worse this day--wetter, muddier, colder.
Becky had seen her stand and wait many a time before, and knew that in a few seconds she would uncover an enlightened, laughing face.
Let us give up Paris and begin in London.
"Several of you here have also been eleven years old, but Sara's birthdays are rather different from other little girls' birthdays.
Veronica Eustacia and Rosalind Gladys, in white-lace frocks and lovely sashes, had just got in, and Guy Clarence, aged five, was following them.
"Yes, it's papa," Donald proclaimed.
When Lavinia laughed at my muddy skirt as I passed her in the hall, I thought of something to say all in a flash--and I only just stopped myself in time.
At least it seemed so to Sara, and nothing had ever been quite so beautiful to her as the things she saw as she stood on the table--her body half out of the skylight--the sparrows twittering with sunset softness on the slates.
"She is a doll I haven't got yet," she said.
At seven mysteries must be made very clear if one is to understand them.
Give her books, and she would devour them and end by knowing them by heart.
"She's growing so fast and learning such a lot, somehow," said Jessie to Lavinia, "that she will be given classes soon, and Miss Minchin knows she will have to work for nothing.
"What WERE his business troubles?" she said.
"Don't you remember?" she demanded.
Perhaps if I were not so timid it would be better for the school and for both of us.
He knew it before she laid her soft, caressing little paw on him and drew him towards her.
"My dear Sara," she said, "Becky is the scullery maid.
He had felt human love in the slim brown hands of Ram Dass, and he felt it in hers.
"I am Boris," it read; "I serve the Princess Sara." There was nothing the Indian gentleman loved more than the recollection of the little princess in rags and tatters.
The fortune which Captain Crewe supposed he had lost has been recovered, and is now in Mr.
Her own lessons became things of the past.
Among other things, she had heard that he was a rich father who was willing to spend a great deal of money on his little daughter.
The blinds were not yet drawn in the windows of the room where she nearly always caught glimpses of members of the Large Family.
Miss Minchin herself also looked rather disturbed, it must be admitted, and she gazed at the dry little gentleman with an irritated and puzzled expression.
"Well, you wait a minute," said Sara, "and I'll take off my wet things and wrap myself in the coverlet and tell you over again." She took off her hat and coat and hung them on a nail against the wall, and she changed her wet shoes for an old pair of slippers.
"This 'ere," she suggested, with a glance round the attic--"is it the Bastille now--or has it turned into somethin' different?" "Oh, yes, yes!" said Sara.
It had not been put in the attic for her benefit, but because there was no room for it elsewhere.
"Why, anyone can make up things," she said.
I have seen and talked to her.
"What is the matter, Becky?" Sara cried.
Principally, she was thinking of what a queer thing it was that at one time one was in India in the blazing sun, and then in the middle of the ocean, and then driving in a strange vehicle through strange streets where the day was as dark as the night.
No time must be lost," Mr.
"Oh, she got back to her seat before we could see her!" Sara explained.
Carmichael paused a moment, as if a new thought had occurred to him.
The sight of them gave her a weird, homesick feeling.
"I--I have never really learned French, but--but--" she began, trying shyly to make herself clear.
"I am sorry of that, mademoiselle," he said kindly to Sara.
But suddenly she thought of something else and ran to the rusty grate.
"Oh--oh--oh!" Sara heard; "I haven't got any mam--ma-a!" "Oh, Lottie!" screamed Miss Amelia.
It really seemed as if it might be so.
"He wants you to come to him." Sara did not wait.
Oh--and bring the soap dish for a centerpiece." Becky handed them to her reverently.
They had no other children, and Madame Pascal said that they were extremely well-to-do Russians." "And the wretched woman actually did not know where they had taken her!" exclaimed Mr.
It was a queer little sound she heard--like a soft scratching.
That spoiled, pampered, fanciful child is left a pauper on my hands." Miss Amelia sat down quite heavily in the nearest chair.
People jump and run away and scream out, 'Oh, a horrid rat!' I shouldn't like people to scream and jump and say, 'Oh, a horrid Sara!' the moment they saw me.
They heard her door shut, and knew that she threw herself upon her bed.
"Suppose," she whispered in pleased excitement--"just suppose it was the monkey who got away again.
There were more errands to be done, the cook was more irritable, and, knowing that Sara was in disgrace, she was more savage.
"How are you?" "I'm--I'm quite well," said Ermengarde, overwhelmed with shyness.
She made a curtsy--and it was a very nice one.
For a few seconds she quite lost her breath.
"Yes," said Sara, "and I was thinking what would happen if I were a princess and you boxed my ears--what I should do to you.
"Nasty, little spoiled thing, I should like to SLAP her!" Sara got up quickly on her feet.
Then she jumped on the bed, and drawing the coverlet about her shoulders, sat with her arms round her knees.
Several of the other children began to cry, but she did not seem to hear them or to be alive to anything but just what I was saying.
She ought to play more with dolls." "Papa," said Sara, "you see, if I went out and bought a new doll every few days I should have more than I could be fond of.
"In a moment," he answered her.
She had large, cold, fishy eyes, and a large, cold, fishy smile.
"The new girl sleeps in your room, and it isn't pretty any more." "I live in another room," said Sara.
Do you hear?" She looked at the staring glass eyes and complacent face, and suddenly a sort of heartbroken rage seized her.
She began to arrange them upon the red table-cover, patting and coaxing them into shape with the narrow lace edge curling outward, her Magic working its spells for her as she did it.
The worst thing never QUITE comes." She gave Becky a little cheerful shake.
"It's a lonely place," she said.
She had had toys and pets and an ayah who worshipped her, and she had gradually learned that people who were rich had these things.
And--ahem--I have always been fond of you." Sara's green-gray eyes fixed themselves on her with the quiet, clear look Miss Minchin particularly disliked.
She did not know what was going to happen.
What a villain he must have thought me!" "Don't reproach yourself so bitterly." "I don't reproach myself because the speculation threatened to fail--I reproach myself for losing my courage.
After Sara had sat in her seat in the schoolroom for a few minutes, being looked at by the pupils, Miss Minchin rapped in a dignified manner upon her desk.
Her papa loved it, and she loved it because he did.
I'm not clever, and my father is, and he thinks I ought to be." Sara was opening one book after the other.
Carmichael answered him in a rather low voice.
"Go to bed this instant." And she shut the door behind herself and poor stumbling Ermengarde, and left Sara standing quite alone.
A number of books were piled upon it.
Buns are a penny each.
He trusted me--he LOVED me.
You can just watch them, and think about them and be sorry for them, until they seem almost like relations.
"I was at first--but I am not now." "Was it--a ghost?" quaked Ermengarde.
"I'm allus hungry," was the answer, "but 't ain't as bad as it was." "Come in here," said the woman, and she held open the shop door.
It had been snowing all day, and on the snow, quite near her, crouched a tiny, shivering figure, whose small black face wrinkled itself piteously at sight of her.
At this hour a great deal of talking was done, and a great many secrets changed hands, particularly if the younger pupils behaved themselves well, and did not squabble or run about noisily, which it must be confessed they usually did.
She had led because she was capable of making herself extremely disagreeable if the others did not follow her.
"She is a doll papa is going to buy for me.
"If you find the little girl, give her our love," shouted Guy Clarence, jumping up and down on the door mat.
Barrow did not sit down at once.
Lottie has already upset her tea." That was the beginning, and from day to day the duties given to her were added to.
You are a DOLL!" Emily lay on the floor, with her legs ignominiously doubled up over her head, and a new flat place on the end of her nose; but she was calm, even dignified.
And at last, evidently in response to it, a gray-whiskered, bright-eyed head peeped out of the hole.
Then she said in an awed voice, "Onct I see a princess.
Then he lifted her out of the cab and they mounted the steps and rang the bell.
She joined a group of little ones who were playing in a corner.
The cook she's like one of the under-jailers.
Unpleasant story to get about in connection with the establishment.
She was clenching her little teeth and opening and shutting fiercely her outstretched hands.
It will make such a nice red tablecloth." They pulled the old table forward, and threw the shawl over it.
"Couldn't you go to school, too?
"Now, Lottie, you PROMISED Sara." "She said I was a cry-baby," wept Lottie.
"She does not really want to talk to me.
"There is such a yellow gentleman next door, Sara," Lottie whispered at the French class afterward.
"The time for that sort of thing is past.
I am sorry to take you back, monkey; but you must go.
She went downstairs again, looking almost alarmed.
Sara did as she was told.
"You leave the house in the morning!" Sara stood quite still, her eyes growing larger, her face paler.
You decorated the table, I suppose--with this rubbish." She stamped her foot at Becky.
"But I don't care--I don't care a bit.
Brown will let you be the one to give the buns and bread to the children.
She was not in the least like Isobel Grange, who had been the beauty of the regiment, but she had an odd charm of her own.
She held Emily tightly in one arm, and Emily was swathed in a piece of black material.
The door had scarcely closed before every seat was empty.
If you were a princess, you did not fly into rages.
How can she know things?" "Do you think she DOESN'T know things?" said Sara, in her stern little voice.
She's so hungry sometimes that she eats crusts out of the ash barrel!" She pressed her hands hard against her face and burst into passionate little sobs, and Ermengarde, hearing this unusual thing, was overawed by it.
I only THINK I see it all." Her words began to hurry themselves.
The child was to have anything she wanted.
He was always amused and interested, and he began to find an actual pleasure in the possession of the wealth he had imagined that he loathed the burden of.
The truth was that the poor fellow felt as if his gods had intervened, and the kind little voice came from heaven itself.
"What is Sara thinking of?" "Is this the place?" Sara whispered, cuddling still closer to him.
But after yesterday's deprivation of meals, the violent scene of last night, the prospect of hunger today, she must surely have broken down.
She told it quite simply, and in as few words as possible; but somehow the Indian gentleman found it necessary to shade his eyes with his hand and look down at the carpet.
Becky was driven like a little slave.
Also it was true that while Lottie disliked Miss Minchin, who was cross, and Miss Amelia, who was foolishly indulgent, she rather liked Sara, little as she knew her.
You talk about Melchisedec as if he was a person." "He IS a person," said Sara.
The sound suggested that something was moving on the roof.
Sara flew across the room and, kneeling down, put her arms round her.
"I wish she hadn't gone so quick," she said.
She looked up with a wildly elated face.
She was a spoiled child yet, but she was fond enough of her adopted parent to make an effort to control herself for her sake.
It actually had, and it had done even more than before.
"Lady Meredith has told me of her unusual cleverness.
"You know why I will not go home with you, Miss Minchin," she said; "you know quite well." A hot flush showed itself on Miss Minchin's hard, angry face.
And the streets are shining.
"That you can't learn things quickly," amended Sara.
Melchisedec with him sometimes, and now and then one or two of his children.
Sara thought them enchanting, and painted pictures, for Ermengarde and Lottie, of labyrinthine passages in the bowels of the earth, where sparkling stones studded the walls and roofs and ceilings, and strange, dark men dug them out with heavy picks.
If Sara herself wishes to return to you, I dare say Mr.
He drew a big sigh and pulled his mustache with a boyish expression.
"I do not understand." "Birthday presents," said Mr.
"Soldiers don't complain," she would say between her small, shut teeth, "I am not going to do it; I will pretend this is part of a war." But there were hours when her child heart might almost have broken with loneliness but for three people.
And when she saw that the pupils had been listening and that Lavinia and Jessie were giggling behind their French grammars, she felt infuriated.
"Miss Minchin is looking at us.
So he put his hand in his pocket and found his sixpence and walked up to her benignly.
It certainly was an odd thing that happened to Sara.
The narrow couch in the next attic was more comfortable that night than its occupant had ever dreamed that it could be.
"If one was a beggar, one would have to suppose and pretend all the time.
He seemed particularly fond of the two elder little girls--the Janet and Nora who had been so alarmed when their small brother Donald had given Sara his sixpence.
"The cook takes things herself and then says Becky steals them.
She turned, and mounted up two flights of stairs.
And it was only another little girl.
Sara was quite sure he knew it.
"See," she said, putting the bun in the ragged lap, "this is nice and hot.
"If she's so fond of her, why doesn't she keep her in her own room?
I knew you were ill and might not like to be disturbed." The Indian gentleman's hollow eyes dwelt on her with curious interest.
As the things have been sent, and you are to have new ones when they are worn out, you may as well go and put them on and look respectable.
"No one else ever comes and looks into the bedrooms after we are in bed.
But in Sara's hungry eyes the old light had begun to glow and transform her world for her.
So he held her very closely in his arms as the cab rolled into the big, dull square in which stood the house which was their destination.
"You see, I know what it is to be hungry, and it is very hard when one cannot even PRETEND it away." "Yes, yes, my dear," said the Indian gentleman.
My impression is that your papa wished you to learn French." If Sara had been older or less punctilious about being quite polite to people, she could have explained herself in a very few words.
If you don't please me, you will be sent away.
Leave the room this instant, or you'll leave your place." Becky threw her apron over her head and fled.
I wonder if there is something else." If there was something else--something even servants did not hear of--she could not help believing that the father of the Large Family knew it--the gentleman she called Mr.
"The friend might have MEANT to do no harm," he said.
She struck a match and lit the candle.
"I am wondering what I ought to do." Becky stared--still respectfully.
"What a wreck I am!" Mr.
She forgot that she was talking to listening children; she saw and lived with the fairy folk, or the kings and queens and beautiful ladies, whose adventures she was narrating.
I have called her Emily.
Attend to your lessons, young ladies!" Sara made a little bow.
But I couldn't help hearin'." Suddenly it seemed almost as if she lost all fear of the awful lady before her.
She crept off the bed in the dark and found her way to the table where the candle stood.
Afterward they sat down upon the floor together, Sara clasping her knees with her arms, and Ermengarde rolled up in her shawl.
"He was your father's friend," Mr.
Just at that moment her torn heart swelled within her, and she felt that if anyone was as stupid as that, one had better get away from her.
I feel as if I might wish for anything--diamonds or bags of gold--and they would appear!
"I will be your mamma," she said.
"If you have not learned, you must begin at once.
"I run errands for the cook--I do anything she tells me; and I teach the little ones their lessons." "Question her, Carmichael," said Mr.
Carmichael to go to her, by actually coming in search of her pupil herself.
There was a head and a part of a body emerging from the skylight, but it was not the head or body of a little girl or a housemaid; it was the picturesque white-swathed form and dark-faced, gleaming-eyed, white-turbaned head of a native Indian man-servant--"a Lascar," Sara said to herself quickly--and the sound she had heard came from a small monkey he held in his arms as if he were fond of it, and which was snuggling and chattering against his breast.
When Ermengarde had seemed to desert her, she had felt horribly lonely.
She never invites us to share things.
"Oh, no, thank you; I mustn't take it, indeed!" Her voice was so unlike an ordinary street child's voice and her manner was so like the manner of a well-bred little person that Veronica Eustacia (whose real name was Janet) and Rosalind Gladys (who was really called Nora) leaned forward to listen.
"Laws, who does it, miss?" "Don't let us even ASK," said Sara.
Not quite a sixpence, but the next thing to it--a fourpenny piece.
"They ought not to laugh." When lessons were over and the pupils gathered together in groups to talk, Sara looked for Miss St.
If ever a child was given her own way in everything, she is." "I've been opening her trunks and putting her things away," said Miss Amelia.
This is what she saw.
It was Becky's face, and Becky had been crying furtively for hours and rubbing her eyes with her kitchen apron until she looked strange indeed.
Sara did not hear her; but as she stood with her green-gray eyes fixed steadily on Miss Minchin, she felt herself growing rather hot.
"No, mum," Becky protested, bobbing curtsies.
Her sympathy was so strong that it seemed as if it MUST reach him somehow as he sat alone in his armchair by the fire, nearly always in a great dressing gown, and nearly always with his forehead resting in his hand as he gazed hopelessly into the fire.
"What WERE they?" "Diamond mines," answered Mr.
She went into the shop.
"He is on the sea now, Emily," she had said.
Well, well, she looked hungry enough.
The cook had received a severe lecture and was in a fearful temper as a result.
"I beg your pardon, Miss Minchin," she said; "I know that I am in disgrace." "Be good enough not to forget it and look as if you had come into a fortune.
Mad extravagance, I call it." Miss Minchin drew herself up still more rigidly.
Lots of clever people have done harm and have been wicked.
She liked the sound of the phrase, "long and weary march." It made her feel rather like a soldier.
It made them laugh a little, though they both had tears in their eyes.
"I couldn't bear it any more," she said.
And Emily had been played with, and Emily's own tea service used--the one with cups which held quite a lot of much-sweetened weak tea and had blue flowers on them.
Do you think he ever WOULD jump?" "No," answered Sara.
"And lies--well, you see, they are not only wicked--they're VULGAR.
She knew it was a present, and she thought she could guess whom it came from.
Tell me some more, please, miss--tell me about the subt'ranean passage we've dug under the walls." "I'll tell you something warmer," shivered Sara.
"Ain't yer goin' to tell the missus?" "No," cried out Sara.
The words he had spoken filled her with alarm.
"Beggars have nowhere to live," she said courageously.
And just look at that tiny, rusty grate in the corner.
"Sara, Sa--ra!" "If she doesn't stop, Miss Minchin will hear her," cried Jessie.
Perhaps it was because she had suddenly grown poor and had to mend things and work like Becky.
"He lost all his money and there was none left for me.
I say to myself, 'I am a princess, and I am a fairy one, and because I am a fairy nothing can hurt me or make me uncomfortable.' You don't know how it makes you forget"--with a laugh.
Then she sat down flat on the floor beside her and waited.
There would be no fire tonight, and no rosy lamp; no supper, and no princess sitting in the glow reading or telling stories--no princess!
They were to be heard jumping up and down, clapping their hands, and being caught up and kissed.
And it makes it worse to hear poor Becky.
During the hardest day she could occupy herself blissfully by thinking of what she should see when she opened the attic door, and wondering what new delight had been prepared for her.
She never spoke of it to girls she was not fond of.
"Oh, I HAVEN'T awakened," she whispered, daring to rise on her elbow and look all about her.
She had been learning a new, delightful dance in which she had been skimming and flying about the room, like a large rose-colored butterfly, and the enjoyment and exercise had brought a brilliant, happy glow into her face.
He let her lift him through the skylight, and when he found himself in her arms he cuddled up to her breast and looked up into her face.
She did not look in the least like the rose-colored butterfly child who had flown about from one of her treasures to the other in the decorated schoolroom.
There is nothing left but the prisoners in the Bastille." And she sat down and hid her face.
Her manners--which have caused you to call her Princess Sara--are perfect.
You can do that with people you never speak to at all.
This little evil one, he said, stroking the monkey, was, in truth, not so evil as he seemed, and his master, who was ill, was sometimes amused by him.
"Barrow & Skipworth are not responsible.
The hearth brush fell from the work-roughened hand, and Lavinia Herbert looked round.
It is a thousand pities that he has not found the lost child." "If he should find her his strength would be restored to him," said Ram Dass.
She started back with an exclamation of joy.
I'm cold; I'm wet; I'm starving to death.
Her accent is so perfect.' She didn't learn her French at the Seminary, at any rate.
Miss 'Meliar had throwed it away.
"I am sure you will, ma'am," said Mr.
Carrisford's hands." "The fortune!" cried Miss Minchin; and she really lost color as she uttered the exclamation.
Carrisford, sinking back as if he had lost his strength.
During the first month or two, Sara thought that her willingness to do things as well as she could, and her silence under reproof, might soften those who drove her so hard.
Sara knew they were hungry eyes the moment she saw them, and she felt a sudden sympathy.
"The attic would be rather nice--if it wasn't so dreadful," she said, laughing again.
This was a new state of affairs for little Miss Legh, who was accustomed, when she screamed, to hear other people protest and implore and command and coax by turns.
He knew that the worst thing the man could do for himself, for his reason and his health, was to begin to think in the particular way of this particular subject.
Perhaps there is a soul hidden in everything and it can always speak, without even making a sound, to another soul.
Sara not only could tell stories, but she adored telling them.
Very naturally, even Becky was beginning to look plumper and less frightened.
Miss Amelia might come in at any moment, and if she did, Becky would be sure to be scolded.
Montmorency went to see him often, and Mrs.
She looked in a bewildered way at Mr.
"It was the warm fire--an' me bein' so tired.
"I never saw anything like them--sable and ermine on her coats, and real Valenciennes lace on her underclothing.
"We must make haste and set the table." "Set the table, miss?" said Becky, gazing round the room.
Sara paused a moment to see the little ones lifted up and kissed and the bigger ones bent over and kissed also.
It was more romantic and delightful than anything she had ever invented to comfort her starved young soul and save herself from despair.
Carrisford in his weak condition.
It would not be very pleasant if there were such a one, and he should learn all the truth about the thin, shabby clothes, the scant food, and the hard work.
"Is it true," Ermengarde whispered, as they went through the hall--"is it true that you have a playroom all to yourself?" "Yes," Sara answered.
This evening the swarm was about him, but he was not seated.
As this was her party, it was probable that the speech was about her.
Carrisford found her this afternoon, and he has got her in his home--and she will never come back--and she will be more a princess than she ever was--a hundred and fifty thousand times more.
"I think he engaged her," she said, "because he--he thought I would like her, Miss Minchin." "I am afraid," said Miss Minchin, with a slightly sour smile, "that you have been a very spoiled little girl and always imagine that things are done because you like them.
She did not care where she was sent, so that she might have the luck of being inside the room, instead of being downstairs in the scullery, while these delights were going on.
She looked shy, but she had a nice face, now that she was no longer a savage, and the wild look had gone from her eyes.
"That means, 'Come to me through the secret passage under the wall,' she explained.
A clever child is a great treasure in an establishment like mine." Sara stood quietly, with her eyes fixed upon Miss Minchin's face.
The missus is more like the head jailer every day she lives.
Generally the skylights were closed; but even if they were propped open to admit air, no one seemed to come near them.
Two comforted children sat in the midst of delights.
It was not a very long chase.
If you make yourself useful I may let you stay here.
The ugly walls were gradually entirely covered with pictures and draperies, ingenious pieces of folding furniture appeared, a bookshelf was hung up and filled with books, new comforts and conveniences appeared one by one, until there seemed nothing left to be desired.
Oh," breaking out afresh, "poor little Miss Sara, mum--that was called a princess." Somehow, she made Miss Minchin feel more angry than ever.
She was so cold and hungry and tired that her face began to have a pinched look, and now and then some kind-hearted person passing her in the street glanced at her with sudden sympathy.
The Magic has come and done it, Becky, while we were asleep--the Magic that won't let those worst things EVER quite happen." 16 The Visitor Imagine, if you can, what the rest of the evening was like.
"Suppose," Sara said, as she stood by the table, putting a large, black-velvet hat on the impassively smiling owner of all these splendors--"suppose she understands human talk and feels proud of being admired." "You are always supposing things," said Lavinia, and her air was very superior.
She came forward, bobbing curtsies, but between Sara's eyes and her own there passed a gleam of friendly understanding, while her words tumbled over each other.
"Keep your ears open," he said; and he began to walk slowly and softly round the miserable little room, making rapid notes on his tablet as he looked at things.
"What do you mean by 'At first,' my child?" he inquired.
The fact was, however, that she was always dreaming and thinking odd things and could not herself remember any time when she had not been thinking things about grown-up people and the world they belonged to.
And realizing this, she raised her voice and spoke more clearly.
At last his heart told him they were really nicer than they looked, and he hopped nearer and nearer, darted at the biggest crumb with a lightning peck, seized it, and carried it away to the other side of his chimney.
"What shall I do when I have no one to say solemn things to me?
I feel as if I might be a fairy myself, and able to turn things into anything else." She rose and knocked upon the wall for the prisoner in the next cell, and the prisoner came.
"It is monstrous!" she said.
When they met by chance Sara looked the other way, and Ermengarde felt too stiff and embarrassed to speak.
John was to be told the plan they had made, and for the present the books were to be left in the attic.
The second of the trio of comforters was Ermengarde, but odd things happened before Ermengarde found her place.
"Perhaps, when we begin to study together, I may show you that it is a charming tongue." Little Sara rose in her seat.
"She is like the others," she had thought.
Sometimes this seemed to her a dreadful calamity.
He was very much afraid of her, but perhaps he had a heart like the sparrow and it told him that she was not a thing which pounced.
He died delirious, raving about his little girl--and didn't leave a penny." Now Miss Minchin understood, and never had she received such a blow in her life.
There is nothing so nice as supposing.
"I don't think I know exactly WHAT I am," she replied.
She was only a poor little wild animal.
Then she spoke to her.
But that rests with Sara." "Then," said Miss Minchin, "I appeal to Sara.
Could it be that she had made a mistake, after all, and that the neglected child had some powerful though eccentric friend in the background--perhaps some previously unknown relation, who had suddenly traced her whereabouts, and chose to provide for her in this mysterious and fantastic way?
It was you who were different after I came back." Sara thought a moment.
Sara looked toward Ram Dass, who stood near the door.
"Who--who ARE you talking to, Sara?" she gasped out.
She did not scream, but she gasped with fright.
"Coverlet dingy and worn, blanket thin, sheets patched and ragged," he said.
How do we know he doesn't think things, just as we do?
"It is a long time since I saw a nice place from the inside," was the thought which crossed her mind.
Why don't you like me any more?" Something in her voice made the familiar lump rise in Sara's throat.
"Are you SURE the child was left at a school in Paris?
She is always starving for new books to gobble, and she wants grown-up books--great, big, fat ones--French and German as well as English--history and biography and poets, and all sorts of things.
"I don't know," she said.
"These are books, I know," she said.
I called her to mind the minnit I see you, sittin' there on the table, miss.
Sara slowly moved away from the door and simply sat down and looked and looked again.
"Here it is." And she pulled out the thin ribbon from her neck.
I suppose it was a childish thing to do; but it gave me something to plan and think of.
The geography says the Chinee men are yellow." "No, he is not Chinese," Sara whispered back; "he is very ill.
"I'm not crying," answered Ermengarde, in a muffled, unsteady voice.
She worked like a drudge; she tramped through the wet streets, carrying parcels and baskets; she labored with the childish inattention of the little ones' French lessons; as she became shabbier and more forlorn-looking, she was told that she had better take her meals downstairs; she was treated as if she was nobody's concern, and her heart grew proud and sore, but she never told anyone what she felt.
The Bastille had melted away, the prisoners no longer existed.
In time, Becky began to lose her hungry, tired feeling, and the coal box did not seem so unbearably heavy.
It won't be enough for either of us.
She could not afford to do a thing which would make people speak of her as cruel and hard-hearted.
The little ones, who were accustomed to being disdained and ordered out of the way by mature ladies aged ten and twelve, were never made to cry by this most envied of them all.
I suppose his nursery was crammed with Christmas presents and hampers full of cakes and things, and he could see I had nothing." Ermengarde gave a little jump backward.
He was not very well, and was evidently overweighted by the business connected with the diamond mines.
She was just as happy as if it was largess.
"There they are." Sara looked round and got up at once.
"If we just had something for bonbon dishes," Sara murmured.
"There is something very disagreeable in seeing that sort of thing in a child of her age," said Miss Minchin, with haughty vagueness.
He looked rosier than ever, and brought an atmosphere of freshness and health with him; but his eyes were disappointed and anxious as they met the invalid's look of eager question even as they grasped each other's hands.
"There's some bread in the pantry," said the cook.
"You shall be severely punished.
But really this time it was harder than she had ever found it, and once or twice she thought it almost made her more cold and hungry instead of less so.
"Beg my pardon immediately," said Miss Minchin.
"Who was he?" asked Ermengarde, looking at it quite as if it had not been a mere ordinary silver sixpence.
"Oh, DO you think you can?" she gasped.
Half a meat pie, indeed!" "'T warn't me," wept Becky.
Stop this minute!" Lavinia commanded.
Barrow undisturbedly moved toward the door.
But nobody asked this rat if he wanted to be a rat when he was made.
"Take the things to the young lady to whom they belong," she said severely.
She did it several times, looking entirely absorbed in it.
John's amazement one must recall that a new pupil is, for a short time, a somewhat uncertain thing; and of this new pupil the entire school had talked the night before until it fell asleep quite exhausted by excitement and contradictory stories.
The truth was, they liked princesses, and they all hoped they might hear something more definite about this one, and drew nearer Sara accordingly.
"While you have been away," he explained, "I have been desperate.
"If I'm a princess," she was saying, "if I'm a princess--when they were poor and driven from their thrones--they always shared--with the populace--if they met one poorer and hungrier than themselves.
Color came into her cheeks, and her eyes did not seem so much too big for her face.
"The man will be himself again in three weeks," Mr.
"There was no reason why she should look starved.
Please let her stay--because it is my birthday." Miss Minchin replied with much dignity: "As you ask it as a birthday favor--she may stay.
She knew quite well that if Sara wrote to her papa to tell him she was uncomfortable or unhappy, Captain Crewe would remove her at once.
"He--he won't run out quickly and jump on the bed, will he?" she said.
They came to assist their master, who, when he was helped out of the carriage, proved to be a man with a haggard, distressed face, and a skeleton body wrapped in furs.
It had not worked for her at all since her troubles had come upon her.
"Go back to your work, Becky," Miss Amelia had said; but she had stopped to pick up reverently first a muff and then a coat, and while she stood looking at them adoringly, she heard Miss Minchin upon the threshold, and, being smitten with terror at the thought of being accused of taking liberties, she rashly darted under the table, which hid her by its tablecloth.
Barrow in the same critical manner, "to a child eleven years old!
"Ain't I jist?" she said in a hoarse voice.
"I do believe I could make friends with him." A week or so afterward, on one of the rare nights when Ermengarde found it safe to steal up to the attic, when she tapped on the door with the tips of her fingers Sara did not come to her for two or three minutes.
"The LATE Captain Crewe!" she cried out.
Lottie had been sent to school by a rather flighty young papa who could not imagine what else to do with her.
"We never had such a dreadful child before.
"I was thinking," she answered.
I have tried, and it made me laugh.
Go on with your exercise, Lottie.
"Look here," she cried, "if you'll lend me these books, _I'll_ read them--and tell you everything that's in them afterward--and I'll tell it so that you will remember it, too." "Oh, goodness!" exclaimed Ermengarde.
"It's--the missus!" choked Becky, and dropped her piece of cake upon the floor.
They had always played together and been fond of each other.
She opened it quite tenderly.
"She'll look rather queer when she comes into the schoolroom this morning, I should think--after what's happened.
"I am, sir." "In that case," the Indian gentleman replied, "you have arrived at the right time.
Ordinary pupils were expected to be satisfied with mere necessaries.
"If I do not remind myself of the things I have learned, perhaps I may forget them," she said to herself.
It was quite late when she was at last allowed to go upstairs.
Having done it twice, she did it three times; and, as she was doing it the third time, the sound of the story so lured her to listen that she fell under the spell and actually forgot that she had no right to listen at all, and also forgot everything else.
She only said the kind of thing little girls always say to each other by way of beginning an acquaintance, but there was something friendly about Sara, and people always felt it.
"Look at the Princess Sara!" Everybody was looking, and when Lavinia looked she turned quite red.
In truth, Mariette was sorry for her.
She was used to being made to give room to everybody.
Please believe I do not mean to be impolite or try to find out anything at all; only I want to thank you for being so kind to me--so heavenly kind--and making everything like a fairy story.
If Miss Minchin should choose to mount to the attic again, of course all would be discovered.
This, at the beginning, had been bitter enough; but as time went on it became apparent that Sara was a leader, too, and not because she could make herself disagreeable, but because she never did.
"If I pretend it's quite different, I can," she answered; "or if I pretend it is a place in a story." She spoke slowly.
Poor Crewe had put into the scheme every penny that he owned.
She is beginning by telling a story." She was mistaken, however, in thinking she was an ugly child.
You will stay there all day tomorrow, and I shall write to your papa.
If Miss Minchin knew everything on earth and was like what she is now, she'd still be a detestable thing, and everybody would hate her.
After a while she raised her face and looked at Emily, who seemed to be gazing at her round the side of one angle, and, somehow, by this time actually with a kind of glassy-eyed sympathy.
Mariette told the head housemaid that she thanked her as if she was thanking a lady.
The Magic had been there again.
Sara sat and looked into the fire, reflecting on Becky for some time after Mariette left her.
"I expected that a child as much spoiled as she is would set the whole house in an uproar.
But she had nothing interesting to say herself, and she loathed books of every description.
He also knew that Miss Minchin was a business woman, and would be shrewd enough to see the truth.
All were addressed in large letters, "To the Little Girl in the right-hand attic." Sara herself was sent to open the door and take them in.
"It wasn't scratchy enough." "What?" said Ermengarde, a little startled.
If she were ill I should know, and I would come and serve her if it might be done." "You are sure no one comes near this place but herself, and that she will not return and surprise us.
"I want to be quite by myself, if you please." Miss Amelia was fat and dumpy, and stood very much in awe of her sister.
"Why shouldn't she?" Lavinia tossed her head with great elegance.
"Here, poor little girl," he said.
"Thank you, Sara!" it said, and it must be confessed that Lottie jumped up and down.
"I wish I was as thin as you, Sara," Ermengarde said suddenly.
His efforts to reach them had been unavailing, so he had decided to remain in Moscow until their return.
I'd rather have rats than cockroaches." "So would I," said Sara; "I suppose you might make friends with a rat in time, but I don't believe I should like to make friends with a cockroach." Sometimes Becky did not dare to spend more than a few minutes in the bright, warm room, and when this was the case perhaps only a few words could be exchanged, and a small purchase slipped into the old-fashioned pocket Becky carried under her dress skirt, tied round her waist with a band of tape.
He is just like a person.
"I know I shall die.
Being sad one night, I lay close to the open skylight and listened.
She took up the soft wadded dressing-gown, and suddenly clutched it to her breast and held it to her cheek.
"Do yer like it, Miss Sara?" she said.
"Why isn't it, Sara?" she almost whispered.
"Girls like a grievance, and if she begins to tell romantic stories about herself, she will become an ill-used heroine, and parents will be given a wrong impression.
Lottie clapped her hands and danced about, giggling.
I don't care!" She stood panting a moment longer, and then cried out again.
Lavinia was very spiteful about it, and told Jessie that she didn't believe such things as diamond mines existed.
It became apparent that she boxed Becky's ears.
She merely sat upright and returned his gaze indifferently.
Carrisford," Donald shouted again, "about the little-girl-who-isn't-a-beggar?
YOU could never find out." "I know that," said Sara, "but I thought I would ask you." "Not many would," said the woman, looking puzzled and interested and good-natured all at once.
"You insolent, unmanageable child!" she cried.
"It is because, though she is not exactly a fairy, she will be so rich when she is found that she will be like a princess in a fairy tale.
A man came to the door and left several parcels.
It broke off from a large lump and fell on to the fender.
I only knew that the child had been sent to school somewhere.
"Do you think," Becky faltered once, in a whisper, "do you think it could melt away, miss?
Sara's sobs gradually quieted themselves.
"What do you mean by bringing her here?" "No," Sara answered.
It is queer." She had been at Miss Minchin's school about two years when, one foggy winter's afternoon, as she was getting out of her carriage, comfortably wrapped up in her warmest velvets and furs and looking very much grander than she knew, she caught sight, as she crossed the pavement, of a dingy little figure standing on the area steps, and stretching its neck so that its wide-open eyes might peer at her through the railings.
You are like Becky--you must work for your living." To her surprise, a faint gleam of light came into the child's eyes--a shade of relief.
The monkey prolonged it a few minutes evidently for the mere fun of it, but presently he sprang chattering on to Ram Dass's shoulder and sat there chattering and clinging to his neck with a weird little skinny arm.
It must be confessed that Sara's small black head lay for some minutes on the shoulder covered by the red shawl.
She wakened from her dream at the shock, and, catching her breath, stood still a second.
"Ain't--ain't yer angry, miss?" she gasped.
"I stopped," explained Sara, "because I knew it was Lottie--and I thought, perhaps--just perhaps, I could make her be quiet.
This will be my last doll.
"It does not--melt away," she panted.
Her old mattress and pillow had been removed to Becky's bedstead, and, consequently, with these additions Becky had been supplied with unheard-of comfort.
She lies on it and strokes its head, and talks to it as if it was a cat." "She's always doing something silly," snapped Lavinia.
"I did not expect to see you tonight, Ermie," Sara said.
More than once she had been known to have a tea party, made up of these despised ones, in her own room.
"I shall let him sleep with me tonight, and then take him back to the Indian gentleman tomorrow.
"I WAS supposing," she said; "I was remembering that hungry day, and a child I saw." "But there were a great many hungry days," said the Indian gentleman, with rather a sad tone in his voice.
"Sara's mamma knows everything," piped in Lottie.
The late Captain Crewe--" Here Miss Minchin stopped him with a gasp.
She hasn't a brass farthing to call her own." "But what am I to do?" demanded Miss Minchin, as if she felt it entirely his duty to make the matter right.
Barrow were equally to blame.
"The child has been pampered as if she were a QUEEN." She was sweeping angrily past the corner table as she said it, and the next moment she started at the sound of a loud, sobbing sniff which issued from under the cover.
The reason for this was that, somehow, the rest always seemed to be vaguely in sympathy with her opponent.
"Becky," she said, "weren't you listening to that story?" "Yes, miss," confessed Becky, a little alarmed again.
Then she spoke without lifting her head.
The rat shuffled a little nearer and ate a few more crumbs, then he stopped and sniffed delicately, giving a side glance at the occupant of the footstool; then he darted at the piece of bun with something very like the sudden boldness of the sparrow, and the instant he had possession of it fled back to the wall, slipped down a crack in the skirting board, and was gone.
I wouldn't try so hard just at first.
She seized them joyfully and ran to the table.
At that moment the baker-woman looked out of her shop window.
If it was polished and there was a fire in it, just think how nice it would be.
If there was time only for a few words, they were always friendly, merry words that put heart into one; and if there was time for more, then there was an installment of a story to be told, or some other thing one remembered afterward and sometimes lay awake in one's bed in the attic to think over.
"He had a friend he was very fond of--he was very fond of him.
10 The Indian Gentleman But it was a perilous thing for Ermengarde and Lottie to make pilgrimages to the attic.
She had lace frocks, too, and velvet and muslin ones, and hats and coats and beautiful lace-trimmed underclothes, and gloves and handkerchiefs and furs.
Barrow wheeled round upon her.
"I knew he wanted it for his children," said Sara.
Lottie could always believe in the things Sara made pictures of.
Then, to her surprise, she heard her utter a little, low laugh and speak coaxingly to someone.
And as she stood there breathless under her sense of injury, there fell upon her ears a burst of gay voices from her own sacred room, which had actually been given up to the feast.
"You sent the things to me," she said, in a joyful emotional little voice, "the beautiful, beautiful things?
She had been sent up to put the bedrooms in order for the evening.
Mamma says her clothes always look as if they had been given her by someone who was quite rich--someone who only let her have them because they were too shabby to wear.
"No, it isn't," he answered.
"She must return to it until she is of age.
"I NEVER could speak it!" "Why?" inquired Sara, curiously.
She picked her way as carefully as she could, but she could not save herself much; only, in picking her way, she had to look down at her feet and the mud, and in looking down--just as she reached the pavement--she saw something shining in the gutter.
She actually stamped her foot.
They ain't just--oh, miss, please tell her," appealing to Sara.
No one saw it for a minute or so.
"I have been suspecting something of this sort," she exclaimed; "but I did not dream of such audacity.
Rebecca, thank Miss Sara for her great kindness." Becky had been backing into the corner, twisting the hem of her apron in delighted suspense.
"You see," said Sara, "that is for his wife and children.
"You were born in India," he exclaimed, "were you?
They were aware that Sara was "kind" to the scullery maid, but they knew nothing of certain delightful moments snatched perilously when, the upstairs rooms being set in order with lightning rapidity, Sara's sitting room was reached, and the heavy coal box set down with a sigh of joy.
When she reached the other side of the street she looked back.
I dare say poor chatelaines had to do that in time of famine, when their lands had been pillaged." She was a proud, brave little chatelaine, and dispensed generously the one hospitality she could offer--the dreams she dreamed--the visions she saw--the imaginings which were her joy and comfort.
"They were real," she hurried on.
Sit up at once!" Upon which Miss St.
She might be trusted to be equal to teaching a good deal in the course of a few years.
The fact is, an idea occurred to me as I was thinking the thing over in the train on the journey from Dover." "What was it?
So I tried to keep out of your way." "Oh, Sara," Ermengarde almost wailed in her reproachful dismay.
But the attic was dismal beyond words.
"How DARE you!" she cried out.
"WE couldn't do it," said Sara, seriously.
"Sometimes I do pretend I am a princess.
She felt the blood rush up into her face and tingle in her ears.
Perhaps some people might think that what she said was rather like a fairy story, but it was all so real to her own imagination that Lottie began to listen in spite of herself.
"Don't tell falsehoods," she said.
Her way of doing it was to "pretend" and "suppose" with all the strength that was left in her.
It seems as if I OUGHT to say them.
"I believe you hate her," said Jessie.
It takes such a lot.
"But I has to eat 'em careful, miss," she said once; "'cos if I leaves crumbs the rats come out to get 'em." "Rats!" exclaimed Sara, in horror.
Sara looked up, with a bright color on her cheek.
"They are things out of my old trunk.
I'm afraid I forgot because the cook and Miss Minchin were so cross." Melchisedec seemed to understand.
You see how true it is.
"I--I scarcely ever see him," she stammered.
His quaint little Sara had been a great companion to him, and he felt he should be a lonely fellow when, on his return to India, he went into his bungalow knowing he need not expect to see the small figure in its white frock come forward to meet him.
The woman looked at it and then at her--at her intense little face and draggled, once fine clothes.
It--it makes me cry to think of it." And she went to Sara's side and stood and looked at her worshipingly.
"He's as polite as we are.
I shall go and inquire into the matter, and apologize for her intrusion." Sara was sitting on a footstool close to Mr.
"I have just had this letter from Sara," she said, holding it out to let them see what a long letter it was.
The child got up and shuffled in.
The voice of the storyteller went on and drew her with it into winding grottos under the sea, glowing with soft, clear blue light, and paved with pure golden sands.
On this night Becky sat on a cushion upon the hearth rug and had a cup and saucer of her own.
"Yes," Sara answered, after a moment's silence.
"I am so glad," Sara said.
He didn't mean to do it, and it would break his heart.
What she saw was pretty and comfortable clothing--clothing of different kinds: shoes, stockings, and gloves, and a warm and beautiful coat.
"Because you are such fun when you say them," he answered, laughing still more.
Ermengarde could be told the story and trusted to keep it secret.
Don't you know that Sara is your mamma?
Some pieces of furniture too much worn to be used downstairs had been sent up.
"Is it a nice one?" inquired Lottie.
It would be easy to be a princess if I were dressed in cloth of gold, but it is a great deal more of a triumph to be one all the time when no one knows it.
Somehow, they seemed to suit each other in a wonderful way.
The one she liked best she called the Large Family.
"You are a kind, kind little darling thing." And as he scrambled joyfully into the carriage she went away, trying to smile, though she caught her breath quickly and her eyes were shining through a mist.
It gave her quite a shock.
And then suddenly he swept her into his arms and kissed her very hard, stopping laughing all at once and looking almost as if tears had come into his eyes.
"I'm too fat, and I don't know how.
She did not care, even.
We have reached it at last." And though she was only seven years old, she knew that he felt sad when he said it.
It was queer because, while it was an expression of delighted excitement, it was combined with such amazement as seemed to belong to a kind of shock just received.
At this moment she was remembering the voyage she had just made from Bombay with her father, Captain Crewe.
You're clever, and I'm the stupidest child in the school, but I--oh, I do so like you!" "I'm glad of that," said Sara.
In a moment she did.
"You ran away because your brain had given way under the strain of mental torture," he said.
Melchy WOULD sniff about so.
"We shall find her yet.
"Oh, I am awakening," she said mournfully.
Sara was not to return to the seminary at all.
She refused so strenuously indeed that Miss Minchin was obliged to almost shout--in a stately and severe manner--to make herself heard.
She jumped down from her table and ran to the child.
She opened her tight-shut streaming eyes to see who this person was.
"Poor darling," she said one moment, "I know you haven't any mamma, poor--" Then in quite another tone, "If you don't stop, Lottie, I will shake you.
Anne A Little Princess 1 Sara Once on a dark winter's day, when the yellow fog hung so thick and heavy in the streets of London that the lamps were lighted and the shop windows blazed with gas as they do at night, an odd-looking little girl sat in a cab with her father and was driven rather slowly through the big thoroughfares.
Then, seeing that Sara looked slightly chilled by her asperity, she changed her manner.
Barrow, folding up his eyeglasses and slipping them into his pocket.
I asked my Magic, and it told me to go and look." "But oh, miss," cried Becky, "wait till she's told you what they are!
Suppose she proves to be quite a different child.
Miss Minchin was a very severe and imposing person, and she seemed so absolutely sure that Sara knew nothing whatever of French that she felt as if it would be almost rude to correct her.
But oh, how true it seems!" The blazing fire drew her to it, and she knelt down and held out her hands close to it--so close that the heat made her start back.
There were no longer sunsets or sunrises to look at, and scarcely ever any stars, it seemed to Sara.
"In the gutter." "Keep it, then," said the woman.
She made a sound like a big breathless sob.
Ermengarde delighted in the story, and Lottie insisted on its being retold to her every evening.
"It would have made me feel like a street beggar.
Somehow, all at once, Sara understood.
I've scattered largess." 6 The Diamond Mines Not very long after this a very exciting thing happened.
"Neither do I--to speak the truth," admitted Sara, frankly.
"I beg your pardon, Mr.
I told papa afterward, and he laughed and said it was true.
It's warm and cheerful and kind-looking and happy." She was sent out for parsley to the greengrocer's later in the day, and when she came up the area steps her heart gave quite a quick beat of recognition.
I wonder Miss Minchin didn't turn Sara out--even if she does want her for a teacher." "If she was turned out where would she go?" inquired Jessie, a trifle anxiously.
"Heigh-ho, little Sara!" he said to himself "I don't believe you know how much your daddy will miss you." The next day he took her to Miss Minchin's and left her there.
And, as to her papa, there is nothing so grand in being an Indian officer." "Well," said Jessie, slowly, "he's killed tigers.
She says herself she didn't learn it at all.
Sara went into the scullery.
"I did not know that." Miss Minchin reddened and drew herself up.
I see her when she does not see me.
If you possessed all the wealth of all the Indies, you could not set right all the discomforts in the world, and if you began to refurnish all the attics in this square, there would still remain all the attics in all the other squares and streets to put in order.
"Oh, I do love little animal things." He was evidently glad to get to the fire, and when she sat down and held him on her knee he looked from her to Becky with mingled interest and appreciation.
The jailer won't hear." Sara went to the wall.
"But I am sure she comes out sometimes to see me--though I don't see her.
"Yes," she said in a new passionate way.
"She must be MADE to learn," her father said to Miss Minchin.
"OH my!" Sara took out three more buns and put them down.
"M-must I go and tell her now?" "This moment!" was the fierce answer.
Even when I began to recall her existence everything seemed in a sort of haze." He stopped a moment and rubbed his forehead.
"I was thinking I should like to do something." "What was it?" said Mr.
That there does seem real now, doesn't it?
"She says it has nothing to do with what you look like, or what you have.
And that a man should be compelled to carry about in his breast the thought that he had seemed to wrong and desert a child was not a thing one could face.
"They have got used to Indian things and like them.
"It may have been there for a week, and goodness knows who lost it.
Sara got on to the window-seat, which was a big, deep one, and, tucking up her feet, sat with her hands clasped round her knees.
She learned things and forgot them; or, if she remembered them, she did not understand them.
She has actually made no fuss at all.
Yes, this was another world.
"Have you done your work?" she asked.
Put those things into the hamper again." She began to sweep them off the table into the hamper herself, and caught sight of Ermengarde's new books.
When the Indian gentleman looked at her as she entered, he saw that her face was all alight.
At first she did not open her eyes.
The whitewash was dingy and had fallen off in places.
"Dare you stay here a few minutes?" Becky lost her breath again.
Most of them don't want to talk to me.
You are a story--I am a story.
She was to have a pretty bedroom and sitting room of her own; she was to have a pony and a carriage, and a maid to take the place of the ayah who had been her nurse in India.
John, and finding her bundled rather disconsolately in a window-seat, she walked over to her and spoke.
There were so many charming things to plan for Sara.
I placed many in the plaster where I may need them.
Nobody said, 'Wouldn't you rather be a sparrow?'" She had sat so quietly that the rat had begun to take courage.
Of course the thing loved best was the story of the banquet and the dream which was true.
But she could not--even though she kept her eyes closed tightly, she could not.
"You may leave us," Miss Minchin announced to the servants with a wave of her hand.
"I'm not a cry-baby ...
She dodged out of sight like a jack-in-the-box and scurried back into the kitchen, disappearing so suddenly that if she had not been such a poor little forlorn thing, Sara would have laughed in spite of herself.
But as she started toward the door it was opened by Miss Amelia, who, when she caught sight of the changed, angry face, fell back a step in alarm.
"Oh, Becky, come!" Becky was too frightened to speak.
He had died suddenly after losing his fortune." Mr.
It wasn't because she didn't want them, either.
"It is so little and so high above everything," she said, "that it is almost like a nest in a tree.
"Yes, miss, you are," she cried, and her words were all broken.
"If you can't, you can't.
"What are they now, miss?" she inquired.
She only knew he was rich because she had heard people say so when they thought she was not listening, and she had also heard them say that when she grew up she would be rich, too.
"As your papa has engaged a French maid for you," she began, "I conclude that he wishes you to make a special study of the French language." Sara felt a little awkward.
"That is enough," she said with polite tartness.
I suppose it is a rich family." The vans of furniture came and were unloaded and gave place to others all the day.
She laid Emily across her knees and put her face down upon her and her arms around her, and sat there, her little black head resting on the black draperies, not saying one word, not making one sound.
Oh!" she cried under her breath.
Sara turned round at the sound of her voice.
But what does anything matter when one's Magic has just proved itself one's friend.
As she sat down in one of the stiff mahogany chairs, Sara cast one of her quick looks about her.
"Was he," she said, with a glance toward the closed door of the library--"was HE the wicked friend?
"Could it be--robbers?" "No," Sara began cheerfully.
I should be overeating myself if I went on like this." It was dark when she reached the square where the Select Seminary was situated.
Sara laid her purchases on the table.
Princesses," she explained rapidly to Ermengarde and Becky, "always had minstrels to play at their feasts.
There!" Even Miss Minchin herself could scarcely have controlled the uproar after this; and though she heard the noise, she did not try.
If I go to sleep, perhaps a dream will come and pretend for me." She suddenly felt so tired--perhaps through want of food--that she sat down on the edge of the bed quite weakly.
Sara had always been an annoying puzzle to her, because severity never made her cry or look frightened.
"She is scolding Becky," she whispered, as she stood in the darkness.
If Lottie made any discoveries, she could be bound to secrecy also.
I am sure the Large Family have fat, comfortable armchairs and sofas, and I can see that their red-flowery wallpaper is exactly like them.
"I wonder if he will stay away long," she thought.
After you are dressed you may come downstairs and learn your lessons in the schoolroom.
They were accustomed to being rich and comfortable, and as Sara's frocks grew shorter and shabbier and queerer-looking, and it became an established fact that she wore shoes with holes in them and was sent out to buy groceries and carry them through the streets in a basket on her arm when the cook wanted them in a hurry, they felt rather as if, when they spoke to her, they were addressing an under servant.
If you stay in the room, Emily will just sit there and stare; but if you go out, she will begin to read, perhaps, or go and look out of the window.
Perhaps she is pretending she has had a good breakfast"--with a spiteful laugh.
It is a hideous damp night.
"Well," she said, in a voice such as she had never used since the little girl lost her father, "someone is very kind to you.
There was a sort of comfort in the warmth of the plump, childish body.
It became plain that she had been right in guessing that the newcomers were people of large means.
They went out and visited many big shops together, and bought a great many things.
Excuse the liberty, miss,"--to Sara--"but you look rosier and--well, better than you did that--that--" "I am better, thank you," said Sara.
But Guy Clarence was not to be thwarted in his benevolence.
I have been here for years and years--and years; and everybody has forgotten about me.
A well-known glow came into Sara's eyes.
13 One of the Populace The winter was a wretched one.
I do not even remember, now, HOW I knew it." He was beginning to be excited.
Will be replaced by others when necessary." Miss Minchin was quite agitated.
Then her curiosity got the better of her.
"She is actually waiting there for us!" she said.
Her flaxen hair was braided in a tight pigtail, tied with a ribbon, and she had pulled this pigtail around her neck, and was biting the end of the ribbon, resting her elbows on the desk, as she stared wonderingly at the new pupil.
15 The Magic When Sara had passed the house next door she had seen Ram Dass closing the shutters, and caught her glimpse of this room also.
"If your bedrooms are finished, perhaps you might stay a tiny while.
"These are the plates," she said.
"It will be a great privilege to have charge of such a beautiful and promising child, Captain Crewe," she said, taking Sara's hand and stroking it.
To be as proud as that would be a cruel thing.
She has got one of those petticoats on now.
They were extremely decorous little visits because he was an invalid.
Carmichael repeated, and he could not help adding, with a rather sly, unlawyer-like smile, "There are not many princesses, Miss Minchin, who are richer than your little charity pupil, Sara Crewe, will be.
There was a rush toward the boxes.
"I wish someone lived there," Sara said.
When Sara went downstairs in the morning, the remains of the supper were on the table; and when she returned to the attic in the evening, the magician had removed them and left another nice little meal.
"When her dear papa, Captain Crewe, brought her from India and gave her into my care," the speech proceeded, "he said to me, in a jesting way, 'I am afraid she will be very rich, Miss Minchin.' My reply was, 'Her education at my seminary, Captain Crewe, shall be such as will adorn the largest fortune.' Sara has become my most accomplished pupil.
I never liked her much, but I can't bear that way she has now of looking at people without speaking--just as if she was finding them out." "I am," said Sara, promptly, when she heard of this.
"Don't chirrup so loud, Donald," Janet said.
"I know you by heart.
"I can write to him," she said joyfully, "and leave it on the table.
"Go to your room," cried Miss Minchin, breathlessly, "this instant!
If all went as was confidently expected, he would become possessed of such wealth as it made one dizzy to think of; and because he was fond of the friend of his school days, he had given him an opportunity to share in this enormous fortune by becoming a partner in his scheme.
"What a darling little creature!" "Yes," said Captain Crewe, drawing Sara close.
Tonight I take these things back over the roof." And having said this with a beaming face, he made a little salaam and slipped through the skylight with an agile silentness of movement which showed Becky how easily he had done it before.
He won't mind my thanking him, I feel sure." So she wrote a note.
In the kitchen--where, of course, the servants, through some mysterious means, knew everything--there was much discussion of his case.
She, therefore, had no intention of discussing the matter and laying herself open to innocent questioning by a new little pupil.
"Oh, he needn't know," answered Ermengarde.
Melchisedec had, in fact, found it rather dull; and when the rain ceased to patter and perfect silence reigned, he decided to come out and reconnoiter, though experience taught him that Sara would not return for some time.
Tell us!" There was a perfect babel, and Lottie began to cry plaintively.
One of her "pretends" was that Emily was a kind of good witch who could protect her.
Ram Dass made for him a very clear picture of the attic and its desolateness--of the bare floor and broken plaster, the rusty, empty grate, and the hard, narrow bed.
I've walked a thousand miles today, and they have done nothing but scold me from morning until night.
One kind is the children's, and one is Mrs.
The dear friend was mad on the subject of the diamond mine.
She spoke to him in the language he knew.
But she had already begun to like this odd little girl who had such an intelligent small face and such perfect manners.
"If it were not that I want to say, 'Oh, thank you,' I would rather not know.
"How are you getting on with your French lessons?" "Ever so much better since the last time I came up here and you explained the conjugations.
"But I knew her the minute I saw her--so perhaps she knew me, too." Perhaps she had known her.
She realized that Becky did not know what she meant.
"If I WAS a princess--a REAL princess," she murmured, "I could scatter largess to the populace.
"What next, now?" said Sara, and she stood still and put her hands over her eyes.
"There's one thing about Sara Crewe," Jessie had enraged her "best friend" by saying honestly, "she's never 'grand' about herself the least bit, and you know she might be, Lavvie.
And from that time Sara was an adopted mother.
Emily was sitting by her, and she looked after it, too.
Sometimes, when she was in the midst of some harsh, domineering speech, Miss Minchin would find the still, unchildish eyes fixed upon her with something like a proud smile in them.
"There is a lot of paper and rubbish stuffed in here!" she exclaimed.
In the hall everything was hard and polished--even the red cheeks of the moon face on the tall clock in the corner had a severe varnished look.
A woman of sordid mind could easily believe that most people would not refuse to allow their children to remain friends with a little heiress of diamond mines.
It took Sara a few seconds to control herself sufficiently to remember that she was a princess.
"I am very hungry, and I am much obliged to you for your kindness; and"--she was going to add--"there is a child outside who is hungrier than I am." But just at that moment two or three customers came in at once, and each one seemed in a hurry, so she could only thank the woman again and go out.
"Oh," she exclaimed, "why did I not think of that before?" She rose and went to the corner and brought the case back to the fire.
He does not really understand them, and all this seems so enormous.
THAT wouldn't be any stranger than this.
And she asked it almost in a whisper.
On the rare occasions that she could reach Sara's room she only saw the side of it which was made exciting by things which were "pretended" and stories which were told.
The woman watched her, and listened with an astonished face.
"It is not your place to look at the young ladies," said Miss Minchin.
Come here." And he held out his hand.
Drag her away from her books when she reads too much.
She did not know at all what she was going to do, but she had a vague inward conviction that it would be better not to say such different kinds of things quite so helplessly and excitedly.
Carmichael said aside to him in a quick, low voice.
Go and make her change her frock at once." "I?" panted Miss Amelia.
Nora had found a footstool, and Donald was astride the tiger's head which ornamented the rug made of the animal's skin.
When Sara entered the shop the woman turned and looked at her, and, leaving the buns, came and stood behind the counter.
This seemed to be a disparagement of her best patron and was a liberty.
"Don't sit staring like a goose.
"That means, 'Yes, I am here, and all is well.'" Four knocks came from Becky's side of the wall.
To hear this pretty childish voice speaking his own language so simply and charmingly made him feel almost as if he were in his native land--which in dark, foggy days in London sometimes seemed worlds away.
It was all over, and it could never come back.
"I am growing quite fond of him," she said to Ermengarde; "I should not like him to be disturbed.
"Not too near the young ladies." Becky went to her place, grinning.
"If you tell stories, you like nothing so much as to tell them to people who want to listen.
There were even blankets enough to share with Becky.
She had been kept at work until after the hour at which the pupils went to bed, and after that she had gone to her lessons in the lonely schoolroom.
And think of the people in the Bastille!" "The Bastille," half whispered Ermengarde, watching her and beginning to be fascinated.
But he only patted her shoulder.
Scullery maids--er--are not little girls." It really had not occurred to her to think of them in that light.
"Some people are afraid of them," said Sara.
There were lace collars and silk stockings and handkerchiefs; there was a jewel case containing a necklace and a tiara which looked quite as if they were made of real diamonds; there was a long sealskin and muff, there were ball dresses and walking dresses and visiting dresses; there were hats and tea gowns and fans.
Everything you own is mine." "Please take it away from me, then," said Sara.
We will continue to search for Madame Pascal's good-natured Russians.
Sometimes when she had finished her story, she was quite out of breath with excitement, and would lay her hand on her thin, little, quick-rising chest, and half laugh as if at herself.
She sat with her little black head in her arms for some time.
"Yes, 'm; I will, 'm," she said, trembling; "but oh, I just wanted to arst you: Miss Sara--she's been such a rich young lady, an' she's been waited on, 'and and foot; an' what will she do now, mum, without no maid?
Sara noticed that she put in six.
"I shall be scolded if you do, and I have been scolded all day.
She never was as warm and cozy as this except in some lovely vision.
"May I creep up here at night, whenever it is safe, and hear the things you have made up in the day?
I came to explain that she intruded without my knowledge." She turned upon Sara.
She was fourteen years old, but was so stunted in growth that she looked about twelve.
"What--sort of thing?" Miss Amelia ventured.
"No, it won't melt away," said Sara.
"Did Ram Dass bring the things?" she cried out.
"And I was so near." Somehow, she could not forget that she had been so near.
The truth, indeed, was that Miss Minchin knew that she was too anxious to learn to require teachers.
Don't stir." It was very seldom that Miss Minchin mounted the last flight of stairs.
When Monsieur Dufarge began to speak to Sara, she looked a little frightened; and when Sara stepped forward and, looking at him with the innocent, appealing eyes, answered him, without any warning, in French, the fat little girl gave a startled jump, and grew quite red in her awed amazement.
While the thought held possession of her, she could not be made rude and malicious by the rudeness and malice of those about her.
"I should like her always to look as if she was a child with a good mother," said Sara.
She was, indeed, greatly embarrassed.
"If I can work it will not matter so much.
When she went down to breakfast she saw that her seat at Miss Minchin's side was occupied by Lavinia, and Miss Minchin spoke to her coldly.
If I never know who it is--if I never can even thank him--I shall never feel quite so lonely.
When no one was about she used sometimes to stop, and, holding to the iron railings, wish him good night as if he could hear her.
There were floods of molten gold covering the west, as if a glorious tide was sweeping over the world.
She saw she had made a mistake.
Lavinia, in fact, was spiteful.
She felt as if she ought to be kissed very often because she had not been kissed for so long.
But one of the strongest tests she was ever put to came on a certain dreadful day which, she often thought afterward, would never quite fade out of her memory even in the years to come.
I wonder if he HAS a mind.
Some brilliant fans were pinned up, and there were several large cushions, big and substantial enough to use as seats.
Once inside, she gasped slightly, shut the door, and stood with her back against it looking from side to side.
He's an 'eathen an' bows down to wood an' stone.
Yes; there Ermengarde was when she opened the door.
There is something solemn about it.
Then spasmodically she thought of something to say which seemed more intimate.
She was rather pretty, and had been the best-dressed pupil in the procession when the Select Seminary walked out two by two, until Sara's velvet coats and sable muffs appeared, combined with drooping ostrich feathers, and were led by Miss Minchin at the head of the line.
She was thinking of the big ship, of the Lascars passing silently to and fro on it, of the children playing about on the hot deck, and of some young officers' wives who used to try to make her talk to them and laugh at the things she said.
Lottie Legh worshipped her to such an extent that if Sara had not been a motherly person, she would have found her tiresome.
Some new comfort or ornament appeared each time Sara opened the door at night, until in a short time the attic was a beautiful little room full of all sorts of odd and luxurious things.
But when Lottie remained quite still and Sara chirped very softly--almost as if she were a sparrow herself--he saw that the thing which had alarmed him represented hospitality, after all.
"You must pretend it," said Sara.
She was dressed in the kind of frock Lavinia had been used to envying her the possession of.
There were a great many of them, and she had been running about all day.
When we met we scarcely spoke of anything else.
She was not an angel, and she was not fond of Lavinia.
"You had better not pay for anything more, ma'am," he remarked, "unless you want to make presents to the young lady.
This was so unexpected that it was astounding.
Go in." And she left her.
She was only too rejoiced to have someone to vent her rage on, and Sara was a convenience, as usual.
Donald made a bridle of his handkerchief and bounced up and down on the tiger's head.
"Don't mind me, miss," Becky whispered during the first morning, "if I don't say nothin' polite.
I wonder if I could QUITE forget and begin to drop my H'S and not remember that Henry the Eighth had six wives." One of the most curious things in her new existence was her changed position among the pupils.
"The mistress of the house is not one who remembers that another than herself may be cold." The secretary was writing quickly on his tablet.
She spoke as if she were in a dream.
Sara patted her, but spoke in the steady voice Lottie knew.
"He is thinking and thinking whether he dare.
The child shuffled herself and her rags a little more.
"I will attend to you tomorrow.
"'Twarn't for you, miss," she said hoarsely to Sara one night when she had crept into the attic--"'twarn't for you, an' the Bastille, an' bein' the prisoner in the next cell, I should die.
She was always quite serious.
His trouble and peril had been connected with mines.
He was clinging to her and chattering, and the interesting excitement of finding herself in the Indian gentleman's room had brought a flush to Sara's cheeks.
Somehow, he had gradually grown fond of this unhappy man.
"She is not as other children.
She sat down with stiff dignity, and waved him to a chair.
"But it takes a lot o' stren'th." "Perhaps it does if you are not used to it," said Sara, with friendly sympathy; "but you don't know how easy it is when you've done it often.
"Papa won't be very long now," she said.
"You can see all sorts of things you can't see downstairs," she said.
I have not spoiled you, perhaps," she said awkwardly to the little girl; "but you know that your papa was pleased with your progress.
However heavy it was, and whatsoever the temper of the cook, and the hardness of the work heaped upon her shoulders, she had always the chance of the afternoon to look forward to--the chance that Miss Sara would be able to be in her sitting room.
And it serves us right; but it serves you right more than it does me, for you are a hard woman, Maria Minchin, you're a hard, selfish, worldly woman!" And she was in danger of making so much noise with her hysterical chokes and gurgles that her sister was obliged to go to her and apply salts and sal volatile to quiet her, instead of pouring forth her indignation at her audacity.
"She must be taught at once what she is to expect." Mariette had left the house the next morning.
The people at the school always send her out on errands on the horridest days and nights there are." Sara crossed the square to Miss Minchin's area steps, feeling faint and shaky.
I have to remember things quickly to keep from saying something ill-tempered." She had to remember things quickly when she laid her book on the window-seat and jumped down from her comfortable corner.
"Ah, madame," he said, "there is not much I can teach her.
She had no dinner yesterday, and she's not to have any today." Jessie was not as ill-natured as she was silly.
Now I will leave you to enjoy yourselves." The instant she had swept out of the room the spell her presence always had upon them was broken.
She had felt as if it had been stunned.
She was very like her house, Sara felt: tall and dull, and respectable and ugly.
"Something will come if I think and wait a little"--in a soft, expectant voice.
"I never saw such a funny, old-fashioned child, sister," she said.
Montmorency who was to take it.
And there goes another." "Well," said Ermengarde, "I'm miserable--and no one need interfere." And she turned her plump back and took out her handkerchief and boldly hid her face in it.
"He looks like a very ugly baby," laughed Sara.
Even by that time it seemed to Sara as if the birthday party had either been a dream or a thing which had happened years ago, and had happened in the life of quite another little girl.
And she is a little dark, forlorn creature, as unlike poor Crewe as a child could be." Perhaps the Magic was at work again at that very moment--the beautiful Magic.
She looked at him interestedly for a second, and then smiled across the slates.
"What child am I?" she faltered.
"You live next door?" he demanded.
And he did not know where Sara was.
You haven't a street-beggar face." "A little boy once gave me a sixpence for charity," said Sara, with a short little laugh in spite of herself.
"Have you a--a pain?" Ermengarde ventured.
"I shouldn't be at all surprised if she did turn out to be something.
"Is it, papa?" "Yes, little Sara, it is.
She sat with her feet tucked under her, and leaned against her father, who held her in his arm, as she stared out of the window at the passing people with a queer old-fashioned thoughtfulness in her big eyes.
We have searched the schools in Paris.
In her proud little heart she wanted them to see that she was trying to earn her living and not accepting charity.
"You look bewildered, poor child," she said.
She was sitting in the middle of the bed, with her feet tucked safely under her.
"She must have been in the house for two hours.
If Lottie began to cry and any one chanced to hear, they were both lost.
It is a banquet hall!" "My eye, miss!" ejaculated Becky.
Almost every day something new was done.
They meant rats and mice who were either fighting with each other or playing together.
Look at Robespierre--" She stopped and examined Ermengarde's countenance, which was beginning to look bewildered.
There are three kinds of squeaks.
She says it makes her learn her lessons better.
What can I do?" And then Sara, leaning on the counter, made her little proposal concerning the dreadful days and the hungry waifs and the buns.
Carrisford's sad face had lighted with a smile, and Ram Dass had been so filled with rapture that he had enlarged upon it and explained to his master how simple it would be to accomplish numbers of other things.
But she persevered obstinately, and as the muddy water squelched through her broken shoes and the wind seemed trying to drag her thin jacket from her, she talked to herself as she walked, though she did not speak aloud or even move her lips.
"Oh, Sara!" she whispered joyfully.
The children crowded clamoring around her, as she lifted tray after tray and revealed their contents.
Lottie could scarcely keep still.
"If you only knew!" she was saying to herself.
She sat down upon her heels as she knelt on the hearth rug, and the brush hung idly in her fingers.
It made her quite miserable, and she could do nothing but break into a short hysterical laugh and exclaim--aimlessly and as if without any meaning, "Oh, Sara, is that you?" "Yes," answered Sara, and suddenly a strange thought passed through her mind and made her face flush.
The mud was dreadful--she almost had to wade.
"Are you very poor now, Sara?" she had asked confidentially the first morning her friend took charge of the small French class.
YOU be her." "Well, if you want me to," said Sara.
"And look here; when you are hard up for a bit of bread, you can come in here and ask for it.
The night I staggered out of my house all the air seemed full of hideous things mocking and mouthing at me." "That is explanation enough in itself," said Mr.
It almost made Sara feel faint for a few seconds--the shock, and the sight of the buns, and the delightful odors of warm bread floating up through the baker's cellar window.
"Go and stand there," she commanded.
When she entered she almost dropped in a heap upon the floor.
"What are you staring at?" demanded Miss Minchin, sharply.
"And I was at Miss Minchin's all the while," she half whispered.
Did you see how queer she looked?" Jessie broke out.
She was sent for at once, and came across the square to take Sara into her warm arms and make clear to her all that had happened.
And it all feels as high up--as if it was another world." "Oh, let me see it!" cried Lottie.
"Well, I think it's horrid," she said.
"That will have to be altered some day when she is out.
Oh, I do, miss!" Sara jumped down, and came quite close to her.
Barrow & Skipworth, had charge of his affairs in England and would give her any advice she wanted, and that they would pay the bills she sent in for Sara's expenses.
Your carriage and your pony will be sent away--your maid will be dismissed.
She was so warm and comfortable, indeed, that she did not believe she was really awake.
It was evident that he wanted that piece very much, but it lay quite near the footstool and he was still rather timid.
Its opening revealed the room quite neat and quiet, a fire gently burning in the grate, and a wonderful doll sitting in a chair by it, apparently reading a book.
"I don't believe he worships that idol," she said; "some people like to keep them to look at because they are interesting.
They were not like the other rooms, which were plain and bare.
Several times she was obliged to stop to rest.
There was a rusty grate, an old iron bedstead, and a hard bed covered with a faded coverlet.
He would have been made sad if his favorite had run away and been lost.
When she came back she did not see Sara for a day or two, and when she met her for the first time she encountered her coming down a corridor with her arms full of garments which were to be taken downstairs to be mended.
The temptation to be unreasonable and snappish is one not easy to manage.
"There mostly is rats an' mice in attics.
She had heard it rumored that strange things had happened to Sara, but she could not understand why she looked different--why she wore an old black frock and came into the schoolroom only to teach instead of to sit in her place of honor and learn lessons herself.
Go and bring her in." Then he turned to Mr.
Then there was something worse.
She was a forlorn little thing who had just taken the place of scullery maid--though, as to being scullery maid, she was everything else besides.
Her show pupil, her show patron, swept away from the Select Seminary at one blow.
They will fit better if they are tried on." After a number of disappointments they decided to walk and look in at the shop windows and let the cab follow them.
The Diamond Mines Again 8.
Carrisford thought they were ruined--" "Who is Mr.
She shuffled across the attic in her bedroom slippers, which were too large for her.
"That poor thing!" It did not occur to her to feel cross at finding her pet chair occupied by the small, dingy figure.
Then she got up and went slowly to the bed.
He ran up them as if he felt quite at home and expected to run up and down them many a time in the future.
The Other Side of the Wall 13.
"And she could have eaten the whole six--I saw it in her eyes." She looked after the little draggled far-away figure and felt more disturbed in her usually comfortable mind than she had felt for many a day.
"What is in them?" she demanded.
It was Christmas time, and the Large Family had been hearing many stories about children who were poor and had no mammas and papas to fill their stockings and take them to the pantomime--children who were, in fact, cold and thinly clad and hungry.
There was Marie Antoinette when she was in prison and her throne was gone and she had only a black gown on, and her hair was white, and they insulted her and called her Widow Capet.
The whole thing was so huge and glittering that we half lost our heads.
"Four buns, if you please," said Sara.
Perhaps she would rather not answer her friends, even.
"Tell Sara to come to my room," Miss Minchin had said to her sister.
"A fire I only dreamed wouldn't be HOT," she cried.
If I could only just remember that always.
It was something she had found in the room when she came up to it only two days before.
"I wouldn't do that, madam," he commented; "it wouldn't look well.
Something in the look of her straight-gazing eyes made Ermengarde lose her wits still more.
"Where have you wasted your time?" she demanded.
Having finished giving them their lessons, she was putting the French exercise-books together and thinking, as she did it, of the various things royal personages in disguise were called upon to do: Alfred the Great, for instance, burning the cakes and getting his ears boxed by the wife of the neat-herd.
"An' I never took a bite.
"Take them, then," said Ermengarde.
We talked of nothing else.
"Silence, young ladies!" she said severely, rapping upon the desk.
One evening a very funny thing happened--though, perhaps, in one sense it was not a funny thing at all.
The someone was sitting upon the battered footstool, and was dressed in her nightgown and wrapped up in a red shawl.
"It is no use," he said.
Am I the same cold, ragged, damp Sara?
She took hold of the chubby hand and pulled her close to her side with a coaxing little laugh.
As soon as lessons are over you must make each other's acquaintance." The pupils bowed ceremoniously, and Sara made a little curtsy, and then they sat down and looked at each other again.
Miss Minchin was almost struck dumb by the look of Sara's eyes when she made her perfectly respectful answer.
A little later the carriage drew up before the door of the baker's shop, and its occupants got out, oddly enough, just as the bun-woman was putting a tray of smoking-hot buns into the window.
"Everything will be very different now," Miss Minchin went on.
"Ah," she cried out, "how beautiful!
And there Sara would stand, sometimes turning her face upward to the blue which seemed so friendly and near--just like a lovely vaulted ceiling--sometimes watching the west and all the wonderful things that happened there: the clouds melting or drifting or waiting softly to be changed pink or crimson or snow-white or purple or pale dove-gray.
I don't like those I have.
Ermengarde was too slow a girl to be equal to such a situation.
Sometimes, after she had stared at her until she was wrought up to the highest pitch of fancifulness, she would ask her questions and find herself ALMOST feeling as if she would presently answer.
No one else is as solemn as you are." "But why do solemn things make you laugh so?" inquired Sara.
That Sara will have no fortune!
Sara was sent on errands in all weathers, and scolded and driven hither and thither; she was scarcely allowed to speak to Ermengarde and Lottie; Lavinia sneered at the increasing shabbiness of her clothes; and the other girls stared curiously at her when she appeared in the schoolroom.
"What a nice dream!" she murmured.
"You will have no time for dolls in future," she said.
The Last Doll herself did not seem to mind this in the least.
I was standin' in the street with the crowd outside Covin' Garden, watchin' the swells go inter the operer.
They had passed two or three places without even going in, when, as they were approaching a shop which was really not a very large one, Sara suddenly started and clutched her father's arm.
They were all good and expensive things, and on the pocket of the coat was pinned a paper, on which were written these words: "To be worn every day.
But I am afraid she has a childish prejudice against it.
"Them will be nice an' fillin.' It's fillin'ness that's best.
It seemed a strange thing to remember that she--the drudge whom the cook had said insulting things to an hour ago--had only a few years ago been surrounded by people who all treated her as Ram Dass had treated her; who salaamed when she went by, whose foreheads almost touched the ground when she spoke to them, who were her servants and her slaves.
"It was my whole sixpence." Janet and Nora exchanged glances.
She was in the midst of her dream.
"I'll tell you what, Sara," she said.
Because she had been told that her mamma was in heaven, she had thought a great deal about the matter, and her thoughts had not been quite like those of other people.
Under the skylight in the roof, which showed nothing but an oblong piece of dull gray sky, there stood an old battered red footstool.
She was in a very savage humor indeed.
Are you too frightened to want to see him?" The truth was that, as the days had gone on and, with the aid of scraps brought up from the kitchen, her curious friendship had developed, she had gradually forgotten that the timid creature she was becoming familiar with was a mere rat.
If her mamma had seen her during the last half-hour, she might not have thought her the kind of child who ought to be related to an angel.
That's why she likes it so.
I could stay here until morning if I wanted to." She pointed toward the table under the skylight.
"Can you get across?" she inquired.
"Dear me," she said, "I hope, when you ascend the throne, you won't forget us!" "I won't," said Sara, and she did not utter another word, but stood quite still, and stared at her steadily as she saw her take Jessie's arm and turn away.
Becky feels just as thankful as I do--it is all just as beautiful and wonderful to her as it is to me.
She was muttering to herself.
I hadn't no card o' my own, an' I knowed it wouldn't be a proper presink if I didn't pin a card on--so I pinned Miss 'Meliar's." Sara flew at her and hugged her.
Perhaps he belonged to the Indian gentleman, and the poor man was fond of him.
You looked like her." "I've often thought," said Sara, in her reflecting voice, "that I should like to be a princess; I wonder what it feels like.
"Elle a l'air d'une princesse, cette petite," she said.
Ralph Crewe and I loved each other as boys, but we had not met since our school days, until we met in India.
"I wish you had a 'Little Missus' who could pet you as I used to pet papa when he had a headache.
The dream was quite at an end.
"I must be able to answer him--I must!" he said.
"But then I dare say soldiers--even brave ones--don't really LIKE going into battle." Captain Crewe laughed outright at this.
"No, children," he was saying; "you may come in after I have talked to Mr.
"Do you think he is a Chinee?
She was kept so constantly at work that she scarcely ever had an opportunity of speaking to any of them, and she could not avoid seeing that Miss Minchin preferred that she should live a life apart from that of the occupants of the schoolroom.
The trouble with dolls, papa"--and she put her head on one side and reflected as she said it--"the trouble with dolls is that they never seem to HEAR." So they looked at big ones and little ones--at dolls with black eyes and dolls with blue--at dolls with brown curls and dolls with golden braids, dolls dressed and dolls undressed.
John dreamed of such an hour as the one she spent with the queer new pupil before they heard the lunch-bell ring and were obliged to go downstairs.
I'll creep back to my room and get it this minute, and we'll eat it now." Sara almost reeled.
She was not in the mood to face anything more than she was facing in her room, while Miss Amelia was weeping in bed.
It was Becky, who, in the character of delighted attendant, always accompanied her young mistress to her carriage, carrying wraps and belongings.
"Come up to my room and see," said Sara, holding out her hand.
She was not abashed at all by the many pairs of eyes watching her.
"Do you always pretend it is the Bastille?" "Nearly always," answered Sara.
She seemed to see it as she talked, and she grew cheered and warmed as she spoke.
His whole expression altered, and he showed such gleaming white teeth as he smiled back that it was as if a light had been illuminated in his dusky face.
"Good heavens!" he had said more than once, as he stared at her, "there are times when I think she is as stupid as her Aunt Eliza!" If her Aunt Eliza had been slow to learn and quick to forget a thing entirely when she had learned it, Ermengarde was strikingly like her.
She looked only like an ugly, stunted, worn-out little scullery drudge.
She is beautiful!" And Emily was put into her arms.
"They are beautiful things," she said; "they look as if they ought to belong to a nice person.
The fire was blazing, in lovely leaping flames, more merrily than ever.
"I hope that is my good fortune." "Her papa--Captain Crewe--is very anxious that she should begin the language.
"She is making her cry." "Will she come in here?" Ermengarde whispered back, panic-stricken.
She was cleaner than she had been when she peeped through the area railings, but she looked just as frightened.
"You have to, miss, if you're born a scullery maid.
It was warm and smelled deliciously.
"If you please, 'm--it's me, mum," she explained.
But Miss Amelia's disappointment had made her hysterical enough not to care what occurred next.
The--the flannin wasn't new." 7 The Diamond Mines Again When Sara entered the holly-hung schoolroom in the afternoon, she did so as the head of a sort of procession.
And, after he was quite sure they had gone, Melchisedec was greatly relieved, and in the course of a few minutes felt it safe to emerge from his hole again and scuffle about in the hope that even such alarming human beings as these might have chanced to carry crumbs in their pockets and drop one or two of them.
When she is older she will be heiress to a large fortune, which it will be her duty to spend in a meritorious manner." "The diamond mines," giggled Jessie, in a whisper.
Ermengarde had taken up her hamper to share with Sara and Becky.
Carrisford sat and bit his nails as he looked into the glowing bed of coals in the grate.
I paid the bills for that ridiculous doll and her ridiculous fantastic wardrobe.
And Captain Crewe thought so, too--and he died; and Mr.
"Oh, miss," she said under her breath.
What WOULDN'T I give!" The birthday was to be celebrated by great festivities.
She looked as if she was trying to lift some enormous weight.
She looked Miss Minchin steadily in the face.
"People you never speak to can't ask you questions like that," she said; "and I'm sure the Indian gentleman wouldn't even if he was quite intimate with you.
Her affection for the Large Family increased--as, indeed, her affection for everything she could love increased.
I heard Miss Minchin say to Miss Amelia that her clothes were so grand that they were ridiculous for a child.
And I am going to see her tomorrow afternoon.
"Where is my room?" she asked, hoping very much that her voice did not shake.
"I have part of a bun in my pocket; I bought it with my penny yesterday, and I saved a bit." When they threw out a few crumbs the sparrow jumped and flew away to an adjacent chimney top.
Sara turned suddenly to find her standing by the table, looking very queer indeed.
But this time she was not, and she shook her head.
"If you are four you are four," she said severely to Lavinia on an occasion of her having--it must be confessed--slapped Lottie and called her "a brat;" "but you will be five next year, and six the year after that.
Here in the attic--with the cold night outside--with the afternoon in the sloppy streets barely passed--with the memory of the awful unfed look in the beggar child's eyes not yet faded--this simple, cheerful thing had happened like a thing of magic.
She was so timid that if one chanced to speak to her it appeared as if her poor, frightened eyes would jump out of her head.
She had an idea that if she could see some of the furniture she could guess something about the people it belonged to.
You have to bear things.
She had many opportunities of making her mind think of something else, and many opportunities of proving to herself whether or not she was a princess.
When she returned, wet and cold, to find it blazing, she would think a magician had done it." The idea had been so fanciful that Mr.
She would be glad to learn anything monsieur would teach her, but what she had tried to explain to madame was that she already knew the words in this book--and she held out the little book of phrases.
To keep the house for her father; to ride with him, and sit at the head of his table when he had dinner parties; to talk to him and read his books--that would be what she would like most in the world, and if one must go away to "the place" in England to attain it, she must make up her mind to go.
"There WERE diamond mines," she said stoutly; "there WERE!" Open mouths and open eyes confronted her.
The little figure was a familiar one, and reminded Miss Minchin of days in the past.
A rat!" "I was afraid you would be frightened," said Sara.
A special journey can be made to bring it across.
"If you please," said Sara, "have you lost fourpence--a silver fourpence?" And she held the forlorn little piece of money out to her.
"Oh, laws, miss!" "You see," said Sara.
She is going to be my friend when papa is gone.
A piece of larger size than the rest he took and carried in the most businesslike manner back to his home.
"You--you are not to go in there," she said.
You remember she made none when Captain Crewe went back to India.
And she's queerer than ever.
Carrisford made an effort to rise and sank back again.
We cannot begin nearer than next door." "No," said Carrisford.
"The Last Doll, indeed!" said Miss Minchin.
She had, in fact, overslept herself a little, and as Becky had done the same, neither had had time to see the other, and each had come downstairs in haste.
Sara opened the paper bag and took out one of the hot buns, which had already warmed her own cold hands a little.
"We're so glad you are found," she said.
She was a woman who liked to domineer and feel her power, and as she looked at Sara's pale little steadfast face and heard her proud little voice, she quite felt as if her might was being set at naught.
It's just an accident that I am not you, and you are not me!" Becky did not understand in the least.
"It's a' Nindian gentleman that's comin' to live next door, miss," she said.
"That means," explained Sara, "'Then, fellow-sufferer, we will sleep in peace.
"You can buy things to eat with it.
She clung to Sara in a simple, helpless way; she brought her lessons to her that she might be helped; she listened to her every word and besieged her with requests for stories.
"For my kindness to you," replied Miss Minchin.
It was respectable and well furnished, but everything in it was ugly; and the very armchairs seemed to have hard bones in them.
He put his head on one side, and from his perch on the chimney looked down at the crumbs with twinkling eyes.
I--tell me about it." She was so bewitched by this odd, new companion that she actually stared at Sara instead of at Emily--notwithstanding that Emily was the most attractive doll person she had ever seen.
She has tremendously long eyelashes, but her eyes are almost green." Sara was sitting quietly in her seat, waiting to be told what to do.
Miss Minchin makes that easy enough." Miss Minchin made it so easy that at last they scarcely saw each other at all.
She thought she looked as if she had never had quite enough to eat.
I can creep--and creep--and no one will hear." It was so delightful that they caught each other's hands and a sudden light sprang into Sara's eyes.
"Thank you," she said, "for coming to my party." "Very pretty, indeed, Sara," approved Miss Minchin.
Amelia and I always said you were the cleverest child in the school.
She is always sitting with her little nose burrowing into books.
The circumstances were curiously similar.
When she awakens she will think a magician has been here." He smiled as if his heart warmed under his white robe, and the secretary smiled back at him.
"I am getting very old," she wrote; "you see, I shall never live to have another doll given me.
"I--haven't--any--ma--ma--ma-a!" she announced; but her voice was not so strong.
"He was not wicked, my dear," she answered.
"Do yer?" "Like it?" cried Sara.
I'll coax him in." She put a hand out delicately, speaking in a coaxing voice--as she spoke to the sparrows and to Melchisedec--as if she were some friendly little animal herself.
Ermengarde looked at the odd, big-eyed little face adoringly.
"Perhaps he's sorry he's so ugly," she said, "and it's always on his mind.
I'm sure she is not a beggar!" "She didn't speak like a beggar!" cried Nora.
She had been placed near Miss Minchin's desk.
All about the Prince--and the little white Mer-babies swimming about laughing--with stars in their hair?" Sara nodded.
"I dare say it is rather hard to be a rat," she mused.
Ermengarde shook her head so that the pigtail wobbled.
What would HE say if he knew where you are tonight?" Something she saw in Sara's grave, fixed gaze at this moment made her turn on her fiercely.
I was afraid they would.
When she took out the Last Doll it was so magnificent that the children uttered delighted groans of joy, and actually drew back to gaze at it in breathless rapture.
"Papa always laughed at me," she said; "but I liked it.
Becky, who was not expected to partake of refreshments, had the indiscretion to linger a moment to look at these beauties--it really was an indiscretion.
I like him, you know; but it does frighten me when he sniffs right at me.
Barrow, with a little sinister smile.
"What is your name?" she said.
"Your clothes are a little queer--but you couldn't look like a street beggar.
"If you pretend it enough, you will see them." "Yes, miss," said Becky; and as Sara returned to the trunk she devoted herself to the effort of accomplishing an end so much to be desired.
The skylight was being mysteriously opened.
Eat it, and you will not feel so hungry." The child started and stared up at her, as if such sudden, amazing good luck almost frightened her; then she snatched up the bun and began to cram it into her mouth with great wolfish bites.
It could be made soft and covered with a lovely silk coverlet.
The child nodded her head toward Sara's vanishing figure.
Barrow answered with jerky brusqueness.
To Becky it seemed the most appropriate thing in the world.
"Sara's fortune!" "It WILL be Sara's fortune," replied Mr.
"She is coming," she said.
"Let us open it and look at her things." She sat down upon the floor and turned the key.
Suppose she awakened," suggested the secretary; and it was evident that whatsoever the plan referred to was, it had caught and pleased his fancy as well as the Sahib Carrisford's.
"Is it?" "Yes," Sara answered, and she looked at her dreamily for a moment.
I am so grateful to you, and I am so happy--and so is Becky.
The shock was too much for him.
"Silence, young ladies!" said Miss Minchin, at the murmur which arose.
Oh, laws!" Becky uttered the exclamation in a sort of rapturous groan, and ducked her head over her kettle just in time, as the cook came in from the kitchen.
"It's got cake in it, and little meat pies, and jam tarts and buns, and oranges and red-currant wine, and figs and chocolate.
Look at these." She held an old summer hat in her hand which she had fished out of the bottom of the trunk.
Sara curled herself up in the window-seat, opened a book, and began to read.
She looked instead a strange, desolate, almost grotesque little figure.
When she had finished, he took the phrase book from her, with a look almost affectionate.
What Melchisedec Heard and Saw 15.
There never was a cleaner sweep made of a man's fortune.
Suppose--suppose--a new dread possibility presented itself to her kind, slow, little mind all at once.
Carrisford might not refuse to allow it.
You don't forget, but you bear it better." Ermengarde did not know why a lump came into her throat and her eyes felt as if tears were in them.
Then he slightly started, roused by a recollection.
When she comes into the attic I can't spread feasts, but I can tell stories, and not let her know disagreeable things.
He poured forth a flood of respectful thanks.
Dolls ought to be intimate friends.
Becky stepped aside respectfully to allow the superior servants to pass out first.
The elder girls in the schoolroom knew that if Miss Minchin did not send Sara away it was for practical reasons of her own.
Sara was quite fond of them, and had given them names out of books--quite romantic names.
If you have a father who knows everything, who speaks seven or eight languages, and has thousands of volumes which he has apparently learned by heart, he frequently expects you to be familiar with the contents of your lesson books at least; and it is not improbable that he will feel you ought to be able to remember a few incidents of history and to write a French exercise.
Ermengarde was a severe trial to Mr.
He only knew that she had big eyes and a thin face and thin legs and a common basket and poor clothes.
To hear of the child's doings gave him entertainment.
"She is certainly left a beggar," he replied.
Several members of the Large Family came to take tea with her, and as they sat or curled up on the hearth-rug she told the story in her own way, and the Indian gentleman listened and watched her.
You are not really awake yet." How poor Becky stared at her!
I slip across the slates and look at her many nights to see that she is safe.
The pretty rosy mother was standing near him, talking as if she was asking final questions.
Her hand dropped, and she stood quite still a moment.
When he had gone Sara stood in the middle of her attic and thought of many things his face and his manner had brought back to her.
He looked up from it as he tore off a leaf and slipped it into his breast pocket.
Miss Minchin walked across the room.
Still she was very firm in her belief that she was an ugly little girl, and she was not at all elated by Miss Minchin's flattery.
"It's like a queen's table," sighed Becky.
"Don't you intend to thank me?" Sara paused, and all the deep, strange thoughts surged up in her breast.
Glad as she was for Sara's sake, she went up the last flight of stairs with a lump in her throat and tears blurring her sight.
When she began to speak Miss Minchin started quite violently and sat staring at her over her eyeglasses, almost indignantly, until she had finished.
She wanted to get away from people and go and look at the little magic room once more.
There was an affectionate, happy grin on her face, and she shuffled forward and stood nervously pulling at her fingers.
You can get a trac' for a penny." Sara laughed a little.
"Shall you see the Czar?" "I will write and tell you all about it," he answered, laughing.
She had not learned French exactly--not out of books--but her papa and other people had always spoken it to her, and she had read it and written it as she had read and written English.
"I lose my temper with her often enough, but I will say she never forgets her manners.
The rat she has fed and tamed in her loneliness.
"She is the child I spoke of.
She must be interviewed and told of the change which had taken place in the fortunes of her pupil.
"She has gone out with her basket and may be gone for hours.
"When a man is in the hands of a very dear friend and is not a businessman himself, he had better steer clear of the dear friend's diamond mines, or gold mines, or any other kind of mines dear friends want his money to put into.
His stay there had been prolonged from week to week.
"It is a wonder the child is not terrified of them." Ram Dass made a gesture with his hands.
The mug from the washstand was used as Becky's tea cup, and the tea was so delicious that it was not necessary to pretend that it was anything but tea.
She knew that he would understand as soon as she spoke.
But I was lookin' at the doll, mum--an' I was frightened when you come in--an' slipped under the table." "You have been there all the time, listening," said Miss Minchin.
When the square suddenly seemed to begin to glow in an enchanted way and look wonderful in spite of its sooty trees and railings, Sara knew something was going on in the sky; and when it was at all possible to leave the kitchen without being missed or called back, she invariably stole away and crept up the flights of stairs, and, climbing on the old table, got her head and body as far out of the window as possible.
She has done with finery!" Then Miss Amelia began to wring her fat hands and cry.
It was in this way they always welcomed their father.
She stared so hard and bit the ribbon on her pigtail so fast that she attracted the attention of Miss Minchin, who, feeling extremely cross at the moment, immediately pounced upon her.
"I BELIEVE I could," she said.
"And he will come back for the others." He did come back, and even brought a friend, and the friend went away and brought a relative, and among them they made a hearty meal over which they twittered and chattered and exclaimed, stopping every now and then to put their heads on one side and examine Lottie and Sara.
That the child is a beggar!
If it had been sixpence I could have eaten six.
Good morning!" He bowed himself out and closed the door, and it must be confessed that Miss Minchin stood for a few moments and glared at it.
She was the monumental dunce of the school, and it could not be denied.
They are as quick as lightning." Ermengarde looked from her to the doll and back again.
But it did not seem likely that she would do so for some time at least, unless she was led by suspicion.
"This is not an ordinary occasion," she said.
He had left the children crying bitterly, and felt he would risk a good deal for a few crumbs, so he cautiously dropped upon his feet.
Miss Minchin entered the room with a sternly dignified manner.
There she found two doors near each other, and opening one, she saw her beloved Sara standing upon an old table and looking out of a window.
Her amiability she exhibits by giving you this afternoon's party.
Miss Minchin was betrayed into something like a slight jump.
She felt as if Sara had changed into a new kind of girl, and she had never known her before.
"I have been robbed and cheated; I will turn her into the street!" If she had not been so furious, she would have been too discreet to say quite so much.
"What a bed for a child to sleep in--and in a house which calls itself respectable!
"I believe you are thinner than you used to be.
There was nothing nasty at all in speaking to Miss Minchin.
When she had replied to the letter asking her if the doll would be an acceptable present, Sara had been very quaint.
She had begun to grow very fast, and, as she was dressed only in such clothes as the plainer remnants of her wardrobe would supply, she knew she looked very queer, indeed.
He was in this place as the intimate exponent of Sara, though she had only spoken to him once.
"The Last Doll." And her little mournful voice had an odd sound.
And as she sat in this silence there came a low tap at the door--such a low, humble one that she did not at first hear it, and, indeed, was not roused until the door was timidly pushed open and a poor tear-smeared face appeared peeping round it.
Montmorency sitting in a big chair, with a small swarm round him, talking, laughing, perching on the arms of his seat or on his knees or leaning against them.
"What is that!" she exclaimed angrily.
"I shall pretend that," she said; "and it will be a great comfort." Ermengarde was at once enraptured and awed.
"She is much younger than Captain Crewe's little girl.
"She has locked herself in, and she is not making the least particle of noise." "It is much better than if she kicked and screamed, as some of them do," Miss Minchin answered.
If you had not been you would have stayed and fought it out.
It must be owned that he was riding it rather violently.
Miss Minchin strode over to Becky and boxed her ears for a second time.
Take your ribbon out of your mouth!
One of her unfortunate remarks almost caused her sister to snap her head entirely off, but it resulted in an unusual manner.
"I want her because I know she will like to see the presents," she explained.
"Let us go in to her." "Dear me," said Captain Crewe, "I feel as if we ought to have someone to introduce us." "You must introduce me and I will introduce you," said Sara.
"We must be very great friends to each other and tell each other things.
She pulled herself up and stopped rather suddenly.
She picked up her book with a little jerk.
Carrisford will attend to that." It must be confessed that even Miss Minchin flinched.
"She is a little girl, too, you know." Miss Minchin was scandalized.
Lottie was so delighted that she quite forgot her first shocked impression of the attic.
Relations were sometimes very odd--particularly rich old bachelor uncles, who did not care for having children near them.
Sara was a very fine little person, and had a gentle, appreciative way of saying, "If you please, Mariette," "Thank you, Mariette," which was very charming.
Even Lavinia and Jessie forgot that they were too elderly to care for dolls, and uttered exclamations of delight and caught up things to look at them.
For the moment she forgot her discomforts.
No one looked at Sara in these days, and no one seemed to see her as she hurried along the crowded pavements.
And because I could not find that last thing the cook sent me for, they would not give me any supper.
Then it came about that another wonderful thing happened.
This child, in her short, tight old frock, climbing the stairs to the attic, was quite a different creature.
And I shall never see a penny of it.
Something else had warmed and fed her, and the something else was Sara.
The truth was that Sara could not remember the time when she had not seemed to know French.
"Then the search has to be begun over again," he said.
As he did it he glanced every now and then at Sara, just as the sparrows had done, and his expression was so very apologetic that it touched her heart.
She had been going to say, "It's not your fault that you are stupid." "That what?" Ermengarde asked.
It was deep and warm in color, and beautifully made.
The woman was just going to put some more hot buns into the window.
"Mine is Sara Crewe," said Sara.
Think of the Count of Monte Cristo in the dungeons of the Chateau d'If.
Her thin little chest heaved up and down, and she spoke in a strange un-childishly fierce way.
And if it rains, the drops patter and patter as if they were saying something nice.
This event was the return of Mr.
The fat, fair baby with the lace cap was Ethelberta Beauchamp Montmorency; the next baby was Violet Cholmondeley Montmorency; the little boy who could just stagger and who had such round legs was Sydney Cecil Vivian Montmorency; and then came Lilian Evangeline Maud Marion, Rosalind Gladys, Guy Clarence, Veronica Eustacia, and Claude Harold Hector.
You see, now that trials have come, they have shown that I am NOT a nice child.
She had really been only about ten minutes in the room when Sara entered, but she was in as deep a sleep as if she had been, like the Sleeping Beauty, slumbering for a hundred years.
She would be turned out of doors without wages.
Pretend there is a minstrel gallery up there in the corner.
She went to the door and spoke to the beggar child.
How dare you!" She picked up the books, swept the rest of the feast back into the hamper in a jumbled heap, thrust it into Ermengarde's arms, and pushed her before her toward the door.
Among other things there was a superb god Buddha in a splendid shrine.
The very fact that she never made an impudent answer seemed to Miss Minchin a kind of impudence in itself.
"These are garlands for the feast," she said grandly.
The poor slave of the house comes to her for comfort.
He did not presume to remain more than a few moments after he had caught the monkey, and those moments were given to further deep and grateful obeisance to her in return for her indulgence.
Without the help of an agile, soft-footed Oriental like Ram Dass, however, it could not have been done." Then Sara came into the room.
She had never become intimate with Melchisedec and his family, though they rather fascinated her.
"By the time it stops blazing," Sara said, "we shall forget about its not being real." She stood in the dancing glow and smiled.
"Tell me." "His name was Ralph Crewe," Sara answered, feeling startled.
I believe she is an orphan.
"There has been such a row in Miss Minchin's room, Miss Amelia has had something like hysterics and has had to go to bed." Ermengarde answered them slowly as if she were half stunned.
"No, I don't," snapped Lavinia.
I've axed an' axed." Just to look at her made Sara more hungry and faint.
"She is not going." Miss Minchin felt rather as if she must be losing her senses.
When the mysterious thing which speaks without saying any words told him that she would not, he went softly toward the crumbs and began to eat them.
"For my kindness in giving you a home." Sara made two or three steps toward her.
Oh, she had got herself into trouble now with a vengeance!
"What a silly thing I am not to have thought of it!" "Of what?" "Something splendid!" said Ermengarde, in an excited hurry.
"I--I suppose I did not begin right." Miss Minchin knew she had tried, and that it had not been her fault that she was not allowed to explain.
"Perhaps kind thoughts reach people somehow, even through windows and doors and walls.
"Nobody goes there but myself," she thought quickly, "but someone has lighted a candle." Someone had, indeed, lighted a candle, and it was not burning in the kitchen candlestick she was expected to use, but in one of those belonging to the pupils' bedrooms.
Sara had some crumbs in her hand.
Make her ride her pony in the Row or go out and buy a new doll.
She has not LEARNED French; she is French.
"Stop this minute, you cry-baby!
Such money as she herself had advanced was lost and could not be regained.
During the first weeks of her grief Sara felt as if she were too stupefied to talk, so it happened that some time passed before they saw each other much or exchanged visits.
"The Mermaids swam softly about in the crystal-green water, and dragged after them a fishing-net woven of deep-sea pearls," she said.
"I always thought something would happen to her.
Nuns worked them in convents in Spain." "Did they, miss?" breathed Becky, her very soul uplifted by the information.
"If, when I find her, she has no frocks, we can take her to a dressmaker and have her things made to fit.
"Come on," said Sara; "I'm not a trap.
"What were you wondering?" It was very like the scene in the schoolroom.
"I am sure you will.
She had, in fact, on this occasion had time to become rather nervous, because Melchisedec had appeared and sniffed about a good deal, and once had made her utter a repressed squeal by sitting up on his hind legs and, while he looked at her, sniffing pointedly in her direction.
He looked so queer and so like a gray-whiskered dwarf or gnome that Sara was rather fascinated.
In fact, she had never heard such a nice, friendly sound in anyone's voice before.
Miss Minchin is a story." And she sat down again and talked until Ermengarde forgot that she was a sort of escaped prisoner herself, and had to be reminded by Sara that she could not remain in the Bastille all night, but must steal noiselessly downstairs again and creep back into her deserted bed.
"It is a strange way of doing the thing," he said.
Besides, I keep giving myself pinches; and I touched a hot piece of coal just now, on purpose." The sleepy comfort which at length almost overpowered them was a heavenly thing.
"Oh, Sara," she cried out, "I am glad you have come.
I'm not a princess anymore." Becky ran to her and caught her hand, and hugged it to her breast, kneeling beside her and sobbing with love and pain.
The pupils had been ordered to lay aside their party frocks; and this having been done, they had returned to the schoolroom and huddled together in groups, whispering and talking excitedly.
It is a whole sixpence!" There was something so honest and kind in his face, and he looked so likely to be heartbrokenly disappointed if she did not take it, that Sara knew she must not refuse him.
The children were dancing about, chattering and hanging on to their father.
When one is faint with hunger the mention of food has sometimes a curious effect.
"Here we are, Sara," said Captain Crewe, making his voice sound as cheerful as possible.
So, quite thrilled with expectation, she followed her on tiptoe along the passage.
"Where is she?" almost shrieked Jessie.
She dropped them, and Melchisedec came quietly forth and ate them.
One of her 'pretends' is that she is a princess.
It was Ermengarde's red shawl which lay upon the floor.
These and many other exciting things the children found out by asking a thousand questions.
My papa gave her to me." She had always made Miss Minchin feel secretly uncomfortable, and she did so now.
"A BLACK one?" "She has frocks of every other color.
After Mariette had dressed her in her dark-blue schoolroom frock and tied her hair with a dark-blue ribbon, she went to Emily, who sat in a chair of her own, and gave her a book.
Now we will begin." They had barely had time to take their pieces of cake into their hands--not one of them had time to do more, when--they all three sprang to their feet and turned pale faces toward the door--listening--listening.
On this afternoon, when she had sat down, the sensation of relief to her short, aching legs had been so wonderful and delightful that it had seemed to soothe her whole body, and the glow of warmth and comfort from the fire had crept over her like a spell, until, as she looked at the red coals, a tired, slow smile stole over her smudged face, her head nodded forward without her being aware of it, her eyes drooped, and she fell fast asleep.
"And explain to her clearly that I will have no crying or unpleasant scenes." "Sister," replied Miss Amelia, "she is the strangest child I ever saw.
"Perhaps," she said, "to be able to learn things quickly isn't everything.
"Silence at once!" And she began from that minute to feel rather a grudge against her show pupil.
Would he let her catch him, or would he be naughty and refuse to be caught, and perhaps get away and run off over the roofs and be lost?
"If I do not stir at all, perhaps he will come and get it." She scarcely allowed herself to breathe, she was so deeply interested.
"You see," she said, "there could be a thick, soft blue Indian rug on the floor; and in that corner there could be a soft little sofa, with cushions to curl up on; and just over it could be a shelf full of books so that one could reach them easily; and there could be a fur rug before the fire, and hangings on the wall to cover up the whitewash, and pictures.
Sara went to him and laid her hand in his, as he seemed to want to take it.
Sara made her laugh, and laughed with her; and, though neither of them quite knew it, the laughter was as "fillin'" as the meat pies.
It is true that any other business scheme, however magnificent, would have had but small attraction for her or for the schoolroom; but "diamond mines" sounded so like the Arabian Nights that no one could be indifferent.
"It's exactly like the ones in the stories," she wailed.
"Oh, papa," she whispered, "what a long time it seems since I was your 'Little Missus'!" This was what happened that day on both sides of the wall.
"I was wondering," she said in a low voice, "what MY papa would say if he knew where I am tonight." Miss Minchin was infuriated just as she had been before and her anger expressed itself, as before, in an intemperate fashion.
"It doesn't matter the least bit." "I didn't go to do it, miss," protested Becky.
She turned to the Lascar, feeling glad that she remembered still some of the Hindustani she had learned when she lived with her father.
"A thousand mice might." "I don't believe fifty thousand mice would," said Janet, severely; "and we have to be as quiet as one mouse." Mr.
So their visits were rare ones, and Sara lived a strange and lonely life.
When Sara went into her sitting room in the morning, she found on the table a small, dumpy package, tied up in a piece of brown paper.
"A great big tear just rolled down the bridge of your nose and dropped off at the end of it.
There were several families in the square in which Miss Minchin lived, with which she had become quite familiar in a way of her own.
Suppose--suppose--" And her very weariness was good to her, for her eyes closed and she fell fast asleep.
There was no one to take care of me or to pay Miss Minchin." "Carmichael!" the Indian gentleman cried out loudly.
When they made an uproar the older girls usually interfered with scolding and shakes.
Sara's supper of the night before had given her strength, she knew that she should sleep well and warmly, and, even though she had naturally begun to be hungry again before evening, she felt that she could bear it until breakfast-time on the following day, when her meals would surely be given to her again.
"He did not lose it himself," Sara answered, wondering still more each moment.
What could such a thing mean?
"Now won't you tell your part of it, Uncle Tom?" He had asked her to call him always "Uncle Tom." "I don't know your part yet, and it must be beautiful." So he told them how, when he sat alone, ill and dull and irritable, Ram Dass had tried to distract him by describing the passers by, and there was one child who passed oftener than any one else; he had begun to be interested in her--partly perhaps because he was thinking a great deal of a little girl, and partly because Ram Dass had been able to relate the incident of his visit to the attic in chase of the monkey.
You never really eat things in dreams.
All through the day the light was in Sara's face, and the color in her cheek.
It made me feel quite queer not to be answered; and when you tell anything sudden and strange, you expect people will say SOMETHING--whatever it is." Nobody but Sara herself ever knew what had happened in her room after she had run upstairs and locked her door.
If Missee Sahib would permit Ram Dass, he himself could cross the roof to her room, enter the windows, and regain the unworthy little animal.
As she walked along she broke off small pieces and ate them slowly to make them last longer.
She knows no one does." So for several weeks a barrier stood between them.
The little girls jumped or tumbled out of theirs; the older ones wasted no time in deserting theirs.
"There isn't any banquet left, Emily," she said.
The sparrows, being at home there, twittered and hopped about quite without fear.
"You can speak French, can't you?" she said respectfully.
He came forward with an affectionate, expectant expression as Sara put her hand in her pocket and turned it inside out, shaking her head.
Sara could be trusted with difficult commissions and complicated messages.
"She doesn't understand why Lottie is doing her sums so well," she said; "but it is because she creeps up here, too, and I help her." She glanced round the room.
If she came home from her errands wet and tired and hungry, she knew she would soon be warm and well fed after she had climbed the stairs.
In her own special and pet easy-chair before the bright fire, Becky--with a coal smudge on her nose and several on her apron, with her poor little cap hanging half off her head, and an empty coal box on the floor near her--sat fast asleep, tired out beyond even the endurance of her hard-working young body.
When I see him sitting on the table near the window and looking out into the street with that mournful expression, I always feel sure he is thinking about the tropical forest where he used to swing by his tail from coconut trees.
"And papa will be so cross if I don't.
"Let us begin to call her Your Royal Highness." Lessons for the day were over, and they were sitting before the schoolroom fire, enjoying the time they liked best.
She felt very queer indeed, and very uncertain, and she gave a side glance at Sara.
I thought--perhaps--you might like a piece of cake." The next ten minutes seemed to Becky like a sort of delirium.
"There!" Ermengarde heard her say.
They are as real as we are.
She was used to being ordered about and scolded, and having her ears boxed.
As Sara looked toward him he looked toward her.
"You will have to work and improve yourself and make yourself useful." Sara kept her big, strange eyes fixed on her, and said not a word.
Two of them perched on the chimney top nearest and quarrelled with each other fiercely until one pecked the other and drove him away.
Lottie's chief difficulty was that Sara said so little when one asked her questions.
He would flee from one spot to another, like the lightning.
The schoolroom was to be decorated, and there was to be a party.
Becky had quite forgotten herself in her excitement, and was grinning at Lottie, who was wriggling with rapturous expectation.
"I can't help it--I can't." Her eyes opened in spite of herself.
"Jist ain't I?" "Haven't you had any dinner?" said Sara.
She has no other." The children stood and looked at each other for a few minutes; and then Sara took her hand out of her muff and held it out across the counter, and Anne took it, and they looked straight into each other's eyes.
"He did not really lose your papa's money.
She had to cross the street just when she was saying this to herself.
As the Large Family's carriage drove away, the children inside it were talking with interested excitement.
"And if I can tell it to you in an easy way and make you remember it, I should think he would like that." "He'll like it if I learn anything in ANY way," said rueful Ermengarde.
"How could a man on the verge of brain fever judge sanely!" Carrisford shook his drooping head.
"What did you say?" "Said I was jist." "And then she came in and got the buns, and gave them to you, did she?" The child nodded.
You were in a hospital, strapped down in bed, raving with brain fever, two days after you left the place.
"I haven't one crumb left.
She went up the stairs slowly, but panting for breath and she held Emily tightly against her side.
That was all there seemed to be to look forward to, and Sara stood quite still for several minutes and thought it over.
She reflected a few moments.
In course of time she realized that if her wretchedness had not made her forget things, she would have known that poor, dull Ermengarde was not to be blamed for her unready, awkward ways.
"I was thinking," she answered grandly and politely, "that you did not know what you were doing." "That I did not know what I was doing?" Miss Minchin fairly gasped.
"I AM different," she explained, "though not in the way you think.
She has dimples and rose-colored cheeks, and long hair the color of gold.
Carrisford sat in his reclining chair, and Janet sat on the floor beside him.
You would, wouldn't you, Little Missus?" One of his many jokes had been to call her his "little missus" because she had such an old-fashioned air.
"There is Emily!" A flush had risen to her face and there was an expression in her green-gray eyes as if she had just recognized someone she was intimate with and fond of.
We called her the fairy princess at first, but it didn't quite suit." "Is it true," said Nora, "that her papa gave all his money to a friend to put in a mine that had diamonds in it, and then the friend thought he had lost it all and ran away because he felt as if he was a robber?" "But he wasn't really, you know," put in Janet, hastily.
Her feet were on a chair, her elbows on her knees, and her chin in her hands.
The lamp was flushing the room, the fire was blazing, the supper was waiting; and Ram Dass was standing smiling into her startled face.
It could not be contested that Ermengarde was as dull as she was affectionate.
Miss Minchin is the jailer--and Becky"--a sudden light adding itself to the glow in her eyes--"Becky is the prisoner in the next cell." She turned to Ermengarde, looking quite like the old Sara.
"She's different from other people," said Jessie, watching Sara with her class.
She remembered a quaint little intruder who had made his way into the attic once before.
She liked books more than anything else, and was, in fact, always inventing stories of beautiful things and telling them to herself.
Carmichael's voice approached the door.
Already Becky had a pink, round face.
There were even a nice hat and an umbrella.
In one second it was in her cold little red-and-blue hand.
Her cheeks were red and smarting from the blows she had received.
She keeps it all in her heart." But though she tried to satisfy herself with these arguments, she did not find it easy.
Nothing could ever make you feel.
Through it she could hear poor Becky crying more softly.
Mariette heard everyone below-stairs calling, "Becky, do this," and "Becky, do that," every five minutes in the day.
It's almost like being a fairy.
All the furniture was rich and beautiful, and a great deal of it was Oriental.
"You were tired," she said; "you could not help it.
"I can't pretend anything else--while I am awake," she said.
It was approaching the skylight; it reached the skylight.
It was so unlike her to break down that she was surprised at herself.
Sara drew her in cautiously, but she looked as if something pleased and amused her.
"Oh, please, 'm," she said; "I dare say you'll give me warnin', mum--but I'm so sorry for poor Miss Sara--I'm so sorry!" "Leave the room!" ordered Miss Minchin.
She told stories of the voyage, and stories of India; but what fascinated Ermengarde the most was her fancy about the dolls who walked and talked, and who could do anything they chose when the human beings were out of the room, but who must keep their powers a secret and so flew back to their places "like lightning" when people returned to the room.
"And Sara is too thin." Naturally, Jessie giggled again.
Did you tell him she has new nice clothes?
"You are not kind," she said.
I watch her from my window when she does not know I am near.
He had, in fact, a very tender place in his heart for all children, and particularly for little girls.
"That is what has happened to me!" she cried.
She did not know all that being rich meant.
I'm blest if I won't give it to you for that young one's sake." * * * Sara found some comfort in her remaining bun.
He was an impish monkey and always ready for adventure, and it is probable that the sight of a little girl excited him.
She's such a baby she didn't know she was telling me.
"I--haven't any mamma in this school." Sara saw the danger signal, and came out of her dream.
"What is her name?" asked Sara, who had sat by the table, with her chin on her hands, as she listened absorbedly to the recital.
There MIGHT"--doubtfully--"be good in Miss Minchin." Ermengarde looked round the attic with a rather fearsome curiosity.
Anyone who is kind wants to know when people have been made happy.
"Tea's over and done with," was the answer.
Musgrave about India,'" mimicked Lavinia, in her most highly flavored imitation of Miss Minchin.
And it's a cold night." Quite suddenly she put her black head down in her arms, as she often did when she was alone.
For several days it had rained continuously; the streets were chilly and sloppy and full of dreary, cold mist; there was mud everywhere--sticky London mud--and over everything the pall of drizzle and fog.
"You would if you were my father." "It's not your fault that--" began Sara.
The room had a slanting roof and was whitewashed.
Sara opened a cupboard, and gave her a thick slice of cake.
"What does she mean!" cried Miss Minchin to Miss Amelia.
The Russians were able to give me every detail." How wearied and miserable the Indian gentleman looked!
She did not want to give up her grievance, but her thoughts were distracted from it, so she wriggled again, and, after a sulky sob, said, "Where is she?" Sara paused a moment.
"If I'd just asked what your name was when I gave you my sixpence," he said, "you would have told me it was Sara Crewe, and then you would have been found in a minute." Then Mrs.
When she wanted anything or did not want anything she wept and howled; and, as she always wanted the things she could not have, and did not want the things that were best for her, her shrill little voice was usually to be heard uplifted in wails in one part of the house or another.
But she did not know that.
"It was full of petticoats with lace frills on them--frills and frills," she whispered to her friend Jessie as she bent over her geography.
She says she will grow up eccentric." It was quite true that Sara was never "grand." She was a friendly little soul, and shared her privileges and belongings with a free hand.
She had probably heard some grown-up people talking her over in the early days, after her mother's death.
Lottie had always found, when in her own nursery at home, that kicking and screaming would always be quieted by any means she insisted on.
If Miss Minchin should find out that she--Sara, whose toes were almost sticking out of her boots--was a princess--a real one!
She had learned to know how comforting a smile, even from a stranger, may be.
"I shall expect you all to be very agreeable to Miss Crewe; she has just come to us from a great distance--in fact, from India.
No one had seen such a very real doll's tea set before.
"Of course it MIGHT all have been taken away," she whispered, trying to be brave.
That the very scullery maid should range herself on the side of this child--whom she realized more fully than ever that she had never liked--was too much.
"You can read that while I am downstairs," she said; and, seeing Mariette looking at her curiously, she spoke to her with a serious little face.
I am LIVING in a fairy story.
If she had known, she would surely have tried to soften it for the Indian gentleman's sake.
"She will be very angry.
Console yourself with the fact that when she is found you have a fortune to hand over to her." "Why was I not man enough to stand my ground when things looked black?" Carrisford groaned in petulant misery.
The little children broke into a rueful murmur, and Ermengarde looked aghast.
"It is your doing, I know," she cried.
The days were so dark and long.
Then the door opened, and Ermengarde came in, rather staggering under the weight of her hamper.
One could only see parts of them, however, between the chimneys and over the roofs.
I am a prisoner in the Bastille.
So, as they sat together, Ermengarde did not know that she was faint as well as ravenous, and that while she talked she now and then wondered if her hunger would let her sleep when she was left alone.
She was a large doll, but not too large to carry about easily; she had naturally curling golden-brown hair, which hung like a mantle about her, and her eyes were a deep, clear, gray-blue, with soft, thick eyelashes which were real eyelashes and not mere painted lines.
If I stand here I can hear any step before it reaches the last flight of the stairs." The secretary took a pencil and a tablet from his breast pocket.
It was a book about the French Revolution, and she was soon lost in a harrowing picture of the prisoners in the Bastille--men who had spent so many years in dungeons that when they were dragged out by those who rescued them, their long, gray hair and beards almost hid their faces, and they had forgotten that an outside world existed at all, and were like beings in a dream.
"I like it, don't you?" For a few seconds Becky was almost speechless with admiration.
It is like a square patch of light.
She had shut her eyes, and was twisting her face in strange convulsive contortions, her hands hanging stiffly clenched at her sides.
You see, it's really a beautiful little room." She was walking round the small place, holding Lottie's hand and making gestures which described all the beauties she was making herself see.
Colonel Grange's little girl, Isobel, is beautiful.
"What I believe about dolls," she said, "is that they can do things they will not let us know about.
She looked all cold and wet, and I saw her turn her head over her shoulder and look at us.
But now she was angry enough to be coming at least part of the way up, and it sounded as if she was driving Becky before her.
The cook and the housemaids took their tone from Miss Minchin, and rather enjoyed ordering about the "young one" who had been made so much fuss over for so long.
Nice monkey!" she crooned, kissing his funny head.
"You can't help being a doll," she said with a resigned sigh, "any more than Lavinia and Jessie can help not having any sense.
He killed the one in the skin Sara has in her room.
You never seem even to have heard her real name." "He used to call her by an odd pet name he had invented.
"It is exactly like something fairy come true," she said.
They all like dolls, though some of the big ones--the almost fifteen ones--pretend they are too grown up." Captain Crewe had a splitting headache when he read this letter in his bungalow in India.
Even as Lavinia spoke the door opened and Sara entered with Lottie, whose habit was to trot everywhere after her like a little dog.
She put on pieces of coal cautiously with her fingers so that she might make no disturbing noise, and she swept about the fire irons very softly.
I was absorbed in the magnificent promise of the mines.
She drew her breath in so sharply that it made a funny, sad little sound, and then she shut her lips and held them tightly closed, as if she was determined either to do or NOT to do something.
"Can I work?" she said.
"Thank yer, miss, kindly; it ain't good enough for that.
Would you like to hear the rest?" Becky lost her breath again.
He looked to Sara like a man who had a trouble on his mind still, not merely like one whose troubles lay all in the past.
And perhaps we could coax the sparrows until we made such friends with them that they would come and peck at the window and ask to be let in." "Oh, Sara!" cried Lottie.
She wished it because of the attic window which was so near hers.
The one thing I always wanted was to see a fairy story come true.
Sara went to it and sat down.
"I know I could," answered Ermengarde, and she ran to the door--opened it softly--put her head out into the darkness, and listened.
The shock had been so great that he had almost died of brain fever; and ever since he had been shattered in health, though his fortunes had changed and all his possessions had been restored to him.
"I always was a thin child," she said bravely, "and I always had big green eyes." "I love your queer eyes," said Ermengarde, looking into them with affectionate admiration.
Her French and her dancing are a credit to the seminary.
It was really very necessary.
He settled his eyeglasses and looked at them in nervous disapproval.
We used to be so lonely and cold and hungry, and now--oh, just think what you have done for us!
"What are you 'supposing,' Sara?" he asked.
"We all know somethin' of THEM." "He felt as my papa felt," Sara thought.
When she exhibited them, Becky's eyes quite sparkled.
"He was a darling little thing going to a party," said Sara.
It was followed by another as familiar--the sight of which she found very irritating.
What did she say that for?" After she had known Miss Minchin longer she learned why she had said it.
It was the most astonishing thing Miss Minchin had ever known.
But the hours when Sara and the Indian gentleman sat alone and read or talked had a special charm of their own.
It's--it's not such a bad room, Lottie." "Isn't it?" gasped Lottie, and as she looked round it she bit her lip.
All the bare, ugly things which could be covered with draperies had been concealed and made to look quite pretty.
She had also a quaint sense of being a hostess in the attic.
Montmorency and all the little Montmorencys went, too, though less often.
He was a man who had naturally a rather hot temper, and he did not wish it to get too much the better of him.
I'm dreaming it FEELS real.
Take them up and go back to bed.
It had been all the easier to forget her because she had been suddenly called home for a few weeks.
I would rather stay with you than go to Moscow.
What was it that brought Ram Dass into the room--even as his master spoke--salaaming respectfully, but with a scarcely concealed touch of excitement in his dark, flashing eyes?
"If that young un hasn't given her buns to a beggar child!
Monsieur Dufarge began to smile, and his smile was one of great pleasure.
His attention seemed attracted by the Last Doll and the things which surrounded her.
I ran away like a swindler and a thief, because I could not face my best friend and tell him I had ruined him and his child." The good-hearted father of the Large Family put his hand on his shoulder comfortingly.
She plunged into the gory records of the French Revolution, and told such stories of it that Ermengarde's eyes grew round with alarm and she held her breath.
This sudden change of luck at the mines has made realities of all our most fantastic dreams, and poor Crewe's child may be begging in the street!" "No, no," said Carmichael.
"Oh, Donald," (this was Guy Clarence's name), Janet exclaimed alarmedly, "why did you offer that little girl your sixpence?
When Sara went to bed she found that she had a new thick mattress and big downy pillows.
"And there isn't any princess.
She felt as if she were walking away and leaving far behind her the world in which that other child, who no longer seemed herself, had lived.
Monkey, my love, have you a mind?" But the monkey only put up a tiny paw and scratched his head.
She sat closeted with her all the rest of the afternoon, and it must be admitted that poor Miss Amelia passed through more than one bad quarter of an hour.
When she had accomplished this, she always drew a long breath and looked all round her.
She never pushed them out of her way or alluded to their years as a humiliation and a blot upon their small characters.
"I remember I saw something this minute." It was only a bundle of wool wrapped in red and white tissue paper, but the tissue paper was soon twisted into the form of little dishes, and was combined with the remaining flowers to ornament the candlestick which was to light the feast.
Perhaps"--wrinkling her forehead wisely--"that is what they were sent for." "I don't see any good in them," said Ermengarde stoutly.
"Sara," said Miss Minchin in her schoolroom manner, "come here to me." She had taken a book from the desk and was turning over its leaves.
The eight children were always either being taken out to walk or to ride in perambulators by comfortable nurses, or they were going to drive with their mamma, or they were flying to the door in the evening to meet their papa and kiss him and dance around him and drag off his overcoat and look in the pockets for packages, or they were crowding about the nursery windows and looking out and pushing each other and laughing--in fact, they were always doing something enjoyable and suited to the tastes of a large family.
"Might I--would you allow me--jest to come in?" Sara lifted her head and looked at her.
The boxes containing the presents were to be opened with great ceremony, and there was to be a glittering feast spread in Miss Minchin's sacred room.
That she is left on my hands a little pauper instead of an heiress?" Mr.
She knew what Miss Minchin intended that her future should be.
"You do not look as if you realize that you are in disgrace," she said.
I should like to be your 'Little Missus' myself, poor dear!
"It killed him." "What was your father's name?" the Indian gentleman said.
He slipped through the skylight and dropped upon his feet without a sound.
And this one--in her rose-colored dancing afternoon splendor--was looking at her as if she were not a culprit at all--as if she had a right to be tired--even to fall asleep!
In one of his letters Captain Crewe told a most interesting story.
"How do you know he is a Lascar?" said the Indian gentleman, smiling a little.
Sara was to be what was known as "a parlor boarder," and she was to enjoy even greater privileges than parlor boarders usually did.
What would have happened if she had not hidden it just then, and if she had chanced to look up at the skylight at the wrong moment, I do not know--perhaps the end of this chapter might have been quite different--because if she had glanced at the skylight she would certainly have been startled by what she would have seen.
Bit by bit, Ram Dass had made discoveries concerning the wretchedness of her life.
"Miss Minchin has found us out." Miss Minchin struck the door open with a blow of her hand.
The young secretary seemed interested in everything.
It was rather nasty of you, Lavvy, to tell about her having fun in the garret.
"You have not undertaken an easy charge," she said to the Indian gentleman, as she turned to leave the room; "you will discover that very soon.
Only Melchisedec saw and heard it; and he was so much alarmed and mystified that he scuttled back to his hole and hid there, and really quaked and trembled as he peeped out furtively and with great caution to watch what was going on.
Oh, dear, how they will miss him!
"Now let's tell each other things," said Sara.
P'r'aps she's been found by somebody when she was lost." "There's a cab!" exclaimed Janet.
When the ill-used heroine of her story wakened, she could talk to her.
An English officer in India had placed his motherless little girl at the school.
Emma, put yours upon a chair.
Becky has the other one." Miss Minchin came to her side and looked at the parcels with an excited expression.
After this, the girls who were jealous of her used to speak of her as "Princess Sara" whenever they wished to be particularly disdainful, and those who were fond of her gave her the name among themselves as a term of affection.
It spread itself into a very large smile when she saw Sara and Captain Crewe.
"Go to your attic!" she commanded, and Becky stole away, her face hidden in her apron, her shoulders shaking.
"You gets used to anythin' after a bit," said Becky.
He was young and full of fun, and he never tired of hearing Sara's queer speeches.
How do you know mine are fairy stories?
5 Becky Of course the greatest power Sara possessed and the one which gained her even more followers than her luxuries and the fact that she was "the show pupil," the power that Lavinia and certain other girls were most envious of, and at the same time most fascinated by in spite of themselves, was her power of telling stories and of making everything she talked about seem like a story, whether it was one or not.
I must say I've often thought it would have been better if you had been less severe on Sara Crewe, and had seen that she was decently dressed and more comfortable.
The servants cast puzzled glances at her, and whispered to each other, and Miss Amelia's small blue eyes wore an expression of bewilderment.
How much he understood of the talk he heard I am not in the least able to say; but, even if he had understood it all, he would probably have remained greatly mystified.
The enchantment of her imaginings for Lottie had died away.
She laid the two largest parcels on the hall table, and was looking at the address, when Miss Minchin came down the stairs and saw her.
"I believe I should have stood my ground if I had not been responsible for other people's money as well as my own.
She used to talk to him, and, somehow, he looked quite as if he understood.
What were you thinking?" Jessie tittered, and she and Lavinia nudged each other in unison.
Carmichael answered cheerily, "the sooner you cease tormenting yourself the better it will be for you.
"We like her so much," said Nora.
"I don't like it, papa," she said.
And it turned out that there were millions and millions of diamonds in the mines; and half of them belong to Sara; and they belonged to her when she was living in the attic with no one but Melchisedec for a friend, and the cook ordering her about.
Carrisford chose to tell certain of her patrons how unhappy Sara Crewe had been made, many unpleasant things might happen.
"You DO look tired, Sara," she said; "you are quite pale." "I AM tired," said Sara, dropping on to the lopsided footstool.
"I am not beautiful at all.
We have been looking for you for two years." Sara put her hand up to her forehead, and her mouth trembled.
"What IS the matter?" cried two or three voices at once.
The first time Sara took her in charge was one morning when, on passing a sitting room, she heard both Miss Minchin and Miss Amelia trying to suppress the angry wails of some child who, evidently, refused to be silenced.
Go!" Poor Miss Amelia was accustomed to being called a goose.
"You MAKE up stories!" she gasped.
Perhaps cheering up is too loud, Mr.
She could not help casting a longing glance at the box on the table.
She saw now that they were pricking up their ears interestedly.
"I don't want you to be as poor as a beggar." She looked as if she was going to cry.
"Not listenin'--I thought I could slip out without your noticin', but I couldn't an' I had to stay.
So long as she was too young to be used as a regular teacher, she would be used as an errand girl and servant and yet expected to remember what she had learned and in some mysterious way to learn more.
I only spare you because I am a princess, and you are a poor, stupid, unkind, vulgar old thing, and don't know any better." This used to interest and amuse her more than anything else; and queer and fanciful as it was, she found comfort in it and it was a good thing for her.
"The Magic will tell me." One of her favorite fancies was that on "the outside," as she called it, thoughts were waiting for people to call them.
It was, perhaps, well for her that she was reminded by her small body of material things.
We are not all made alike.
It's so easy that when you begin you can't stop.
She wondered what they were thinking of, and if they liked Miss Minchin, and if they cared for their lessons, and if any of them had a papa at all like her own.
"There!"--darting to the trunk again.
I couldn't make it out at first." She turned round to the Indian gentleman and spoke her next words to him.
"I haven't any mamma," she proclaimed.
Lavinia leaned forward on her seat to look.
"Question her; I cannot." The big, kind father of the Large Family knew how to question little girls.
She had heard a great many desirable things of the young soldier from the lady who had recommended her school to him.
What you have to do with your mind, when your body is miserable, is to make it think of something else." "Can you do it, miss?" faltered Becky, regarding her with admiring eyes.
"Can she--walk?" she asked breathlessly.
"What IS the matter, sister?" she ejaculated.
"Now he KNOWS", said Sara.
She had absolutely no redress.
She knew that the schoolroom was next to the Indian gentleman's study, and she hoped that the wall was thick so that the noise made sometimes after lesson hours would not disturb him.
"And it is not to be wondered at." Sara could only think of one thing.
I almost did," with a hopeful grin.
It was my thought that it would please the sahib to see and speak with her." "Who is she?" inquired Mr.
It was actually a piece of silver--a tiny piece trodden upon by many feet, but still with spirit enough left to shine a little.
"You SHALL be whipped, you naughty child!" Lottie wailed more loudly than ever.
"There isn't the least difference.
When she reached the top flight of stairs and stood before the attic door, it must be confessed that her heart beat rather fast.
She's so queer." "Perhaps the diamond mines have suddenly appeared again," said Lavinia, scathingly.
Behold a letter on the tray.
So, perhaps, they have promised each other to keep it a secret.
He had found out how easy a matter it was to climb across the few yards of roof to the skylight, and this fact had been the beginning of all that followed.
"And now you've lost her," she cried wildly; "and some other school will get her and her money; and if she were like any other child she'd tell how she's been treated, and all our pupils would be taken away and we should be ruined.
"Oh, I know Lascars," Sara said, handing over the reluctant monkey.
"I have nothing to do with that, madam," he said uninterestedly.
That was about it, wasn't it?" "There was no one to take care of me," said Sara.
She was growing used to a certain gnawing feeling in her young stomach.
"I told you about him not long ago.
"She must begin as she is to go on," Miss Minchin said to Miss Amelia.
And there you are!" Mr.
"Have you never tried?" She put her hand warningly on Ermengarde's.
She felt absolutely sure he had come up to look at the sun, because he had seen it so seldom in England that he longed for a sight of it.
Your eyes look so big, and look at the sharp little bones sticking out of your elbow!" Sara pulled down her sleeve, which had pushed itself up.
Here was the "Little Missus," and he had new things to think of and plan for already.
"Why do you look at me like that?" "I was wondering," answered Sara, as she had answered that notable day in the schoolroom.
Oh, my!" Sara heard her say hoarsely, in wild delight.
The child had a bun in each hand and had stopped in the middle of a bite to watch her.
Can you guess what he says, Carmichael?" Mr.
But the next she spoke in a different tone.
"Does your papa send you books for a birthday present?" she exclaimed.
Carmichael explained--in the quiet, level-toned, steady manner of a man who knew his subject, and all its legal significance, which was a thing Miss Minchin understood as a business woman, and did not enjoy.
And Sara hurriedly consoled her.
As she did so she saw something that made her stop.
She has been provided for as if she were a little princess." And upstairs in the locked room Sara and Emily sat on the floor and stared at the corner round which the cab had disappeared, while Captain Crewe looked backward, waving and kissing his hand as if he could not bear to stop.
She was treated more as if she were a distinguished guest at the establishment than as if she were a mere little girl.
Somebody had oughter send him a trac'.
She mounted her table and stood looking out.
I pretend I am a princess, so that I can try and behave like one." Lavinia could not think of exactly the right thing to say.
When he had stood on his hind legs and sniffed the air, with his bright eyes fixed on Sara, he had hoped that she would understand this, and would not begin by hating him as an enemy.
"What are you doing?" Becky opened her eyes with a start.
"And this"--bending tenderly over the soap dish and heaping it with roses--"is purest alabaster encrusted with gems." She touched the things gently, a happy smile hovering about her lips which made her look as if she were a creature in a dream.
Each of them recognized the angry, mounting tread and knew that the end of all things had come.
"I think I have made notes enough; we can go now," he said.
She ran out of the room and down the steps into the scullery, and there she sat down among her pots and kettles, and wept as if her heart would break.
He was very much interested, and all the more so when he heard from Ram Dass of the adventure of the monkey on the roof.
It was a lonelier life when she was downstairs than when she was in her attic.
"It was all a mistake about them.
I had not slept for weeks.
The table before him was heaped with papers and letters which were alarming him and filling him with anxious dread, but he laughed as he had not laughed for weeks.
In the first place, there was Miss Minchin.
It is as if the Magic did it.
I don't know"--looking quite serious--"how I shall ever find out whether I am really a nice child or a horrid one.
She quite made Lottie see them, too.
"Why not?" "At first I was a pupil, and a parlor boarder; but now--" "You were a pupil!
I like to know about them.
No one else ever looked out of the other attics.
I did not remember the child for months and months.
"My papa is dead!" she kept whispering to herself.
But Sara seemed to be telling a real story about a lovely country where real people were.
"Why," she said, "we are just the same--I am only a little girl like you.
Now go." Sara stood still just a moment, looking at her.
"I don't believe she belongs to anybody.
And he told Ram Dass to climb into your attic window and try to make you comfortable." Sara gave a start of joy; her whole look changed.
"It might have happened through a mistake." Sara did not know how unrelenting her quiet young voice sounded as she answered.
Sara would have much preferred to enter in the usual way, but Miss Minchin had sent for her, and, after an interview in her private sitting room, had expressed her wishes.
Becky was too much overpowered by the good luck which had befallen her.
Her short, black locks tumbled about her ears, and she sat still.
When she reached the top landing she was glad to see the glimmer of a light coming from under her door.
He put all his own money into it, and all Captain Crewe's.
"Lottie darling, I'll give you a penny!" "I don't want your penny," sobbed Lottie; and she looked down at the fat knee, and, seeing a drop of blood on it, burst forth again.
"Why, she's with the children in your room, of course." "Has she a black frock in her sumptuous wardrobe?"--in bitter irony.
So she actually put her pride in her pocket, though it must be admitted her cheeks burned.
And I'll tell you what"--a sudden gleam lighting her face--"I can help you with your French lessons." 4 Lottie If Sara had been a different kind of child, the life she led at Miss Minchin's Select Seminary for the next few years would not have been at all good for her.
If I didn't, I don't believe I could live." She paused and glanced around the attic.
"Was that a rat?" he asked Ram Dass in a whisper.
John's chief trouble in life was that she had a clever father.
She knew it would be rude to smile, and she was very determined not to be rude.
At that time it was noticed that Ermengarde was more stupid than ever, and that she looked listless and unhappy.
"Sometimes I'm a bit frightened of her." "Ridiculous thing!" ejaculated Lavinia.
He has looked for you everywhere.
Something made of blue satin was peeping from between the folds of tissue paper.
But Sara saw in two minutes that she was deeply interested in what was going on, and that she was doing her work slowly in the hope of catching a word here and there.
"I had no dinner," she said next, and her voice was quite low.
That night, when Sara went to her attic, she was later than usual.
She was a great deal more like a queen then than when she was so gay and everything was so grand.
I don't think she is pretty at all.
I didn't know what to do.
Her young, handsome, rich, petting father seemed to be the only relation she had in the world.
Every sign of the festivities had been swept away; the holly had been removed from the schoolroom walls, and the forms and desks put back into their places.
It had consoled her through many a bitter day, and she had gone about the house with an expression in her face which Miss Minchin could not understand and which was a source of great annoyance to her, as it seemed as if the child were mentally living a life which held her above the rest of the world.
Women of her type do not trouble themselves about the futures of children who might prove burdens.
All the girls looked up from their books to listen.
"Of course they always do.
"I want her to look as if she wasn't a doll really," Sara said.
One of her queer thoughts rushed into her mind.
Once Jessie, who was passing, stopped to look at her curiously.
So it became her habit to make great use of this knowledge.
"Is it--something that will frighten me?" she asked timorously.
In the stories, kind people--sometimes little boys and girls with tender hearts--invariably saw the poor children and gave them money or rich gifts, or took them home to beautiful dinners.
"A blanket 'all!" and she turned to view the splendors about her with awed bewilderment.
"She looked so hungry," she said.
We are going out together to find her.
I thought you--were different." Ermengarde opened her wet eyes wide.
Accordingly, Sara was praised for her quickness at her lessons, for her good manners, for her amiability to her fellow pupils, for her generosity if she gave sixpence to a beggar out of her full little purse; the simplest thing she did was treated as if it were a virtue, and if she had not had a disposition and a clever little brain, she might have been a very self-satisfied young person.
"I don't know," replied Sara.
She has a carriage and a pony and a maid, and I've paid for all of them since the last cheque came." Mr.
How they removed the covers of the dishes, and found rich, hot, savory soup, which was a meal in itself, and sandwiches and toast and muffins enough for both of them.
Perhaps you do your sawdust best." And she kissed her and shook her clothes straight, and put her back upon her chair.
It seemed to denote something new--some mood she had never known.
It was always safe and easy to vent her spite on Sara.
"I'm not starving," she said--and she put down the fifth.
She found this so puzzling that she moved closer to her father.
"To you?" exclaimed Miss Minchin.
"The Sahib Carrisford has a warm heart.
Emily was sitting with her back against the wall, staring very hard.
"Suppose I had dry clothes on," she thought.
"My mamma has a diamond ring which cost forty pounds," she said.
It must be!" She threw it over her shoulders, and put her feet into the slippers.
I like them, and they like me." "Don't talk nonsense about people liking you," said Miss Minchin.
On the under side of the pincushion was secured a card, bearing in neat letters the name "Miss Amelia Minchin." Sara turned it over and over.
Privately Miss Minchin disliked her, but she was far too worldly a woman to do or say anything which might make such a desirable pupil wish to leave her school.
"Lift me up!" Sara lifted her up, and they stood on the old table together and leaned on the edge of the flat window in the roof, and looked out.
17 "It Is the Child!" The next afternoon three members of the Large Family sat in the Indian gentleman's library, doing their best to cheer him up.
She did not know she had fallen asleep.
Never had they dreamed of such delights as resulted from an intimate acquaintance with the little-girl-who-was-not-a-beggar.
I will not allow such presumption.
She would not have it; she was quite near her and was so enraged that she actually flew at her and boxed her ears--exactly as the neat-herd's wife had boxed King Alfred's.
"Carmichael," he said, "I MUST find her.
I KNOW she was worked too hard for a child of her age, and I know she was only half fed--" "How dare you say such a thing!" exclaimed Miss Minchin.
The slanting ceiling is so funny.
She thought she had never seen more surprise and delight than the dark face expressed when she spoke in the familiar tongue.
By that time every pupil--from Lavinia Herbert, who was nearly thirteen and felt quite grown up, to Lottie Legh, who was only just four and the baby of the school--had heard a great deal about her.
Sometimes I dream of him at night, and he always stands before me and asks the same question in words.
Having paused for a few seconds to find this out, Lottie thought she must begin again, but the quiet of the room and of Sara's odd, interested face made her first howl rather half-hearted.
Someone had come to look at the sunset as she had.
I am fond of him." She had become fond of the Large Family because they looked happy; but she had become fond of the Indian gentleman because he looked unhappy.
"I'll tell it ALL to you." When Becky went downstairs, she was not the same Becky who had staggered up, loaded down by the weight of the coal scuttle.
Let us knock on the wall now.
"Perhaps you can FEEL if you can't hear," was her fancy.
Then he went with Sara into her little sitting room and they bade each other good-by.
Oh, do tell me!" Mrs.
Barrow, has called to see Miss Minchin, and, as she must talk to him alone and the refreshments are laid in her parlor, you had all better come and have your feast now, so that my sister can have her interview here in the schoolroom." Refreshments were not likely to be disdained at any hour, and many pairs of eyes gleamed.
He almost died of brain fever, and long before he began to recover your poor papa was dead." "And he did not know where to find me," murmured Sara.
She sprang up and clutched at her cap.
She had seen him that very afternoon, sitting disconsolately on a table before a window in the Indian gentleman's house.
Her mother had been a French woman, and Captain Crewe had loved her language, so it happened that Sara had always heard and been familiar with it.
That would not do at all.
She can be a parlor boarder again.
It--it WASN'T impertience!" Sara broke into a friendly little laugh, and put her hand on her shoulder.
"It sometimes seems so now when I try to remember.
She was, in fact, not a person one would remember when one was caught in the storm of a great trouble, and Sara forgot her.
But even if I am only a pretend princess, I can invent little things to do for people.
The Splendid ones always make me feel like that." She suddenly turned her head because she heard a sound a few yards away from her.
I MEANS 'please' an' 'thank you' an' 'beg pardon,' but I dassn't to take time to say it." But before daybreak she used to slip into Sara's attic and button her dress and give her such help as she required before she went downstairs to light the kitchen fire.
But those queer little thoughts were at work in her brain, and she was talking to herself, though she was sick at heart.
Come out immediately!" It was poor Becky who crawled out, and her cap was knocked on one side, and her face was red with repressed crying.
Some odd materials of rich colors had been fastened against the wall with fine, sharp tacks--so sharp that they could be pressed into the wood and plaster without hammering.
What can I do?" "You can do anything you are told," was the answer.
Je n'ai pas le canif de mon oncle.'" That was the beginning of the story of the Indian gentleman.
"I should like to live here!" When Sara had persuaded her to go downstairs again, and, after setting her on her way, had come back to her attic, she stood in the middle of it and looked about her.
"Don't put on grand airs," she said.
"Oh, it isn't true!" she said.
But the owner of the smudgy face and the wide-open eyes evidently was afraid that she ought not to have been caught looking at pupils of importance.
Her eyes are such a queer color." "She isn't pretty as other pretty people are," said Jessie, stealing a glance across the room; "but she makes you want to look at her again.
She looked from the frightened faces to the banquet table, and from the banquet table to the last flicker of the burnt paper in the grate.
She wished you to know the good fortune which has befallen her.
Not QUITE as silently, however.
Becky saved it until the end of her afternoon's work, because it rested her to go into it, and she always hoped to snatch a few minutes to sit down in the soft chair and look about her, and think about the wonderful good fortune of the child who owned such surroundings and who went out on the cold days in beautiful hats and coats one tried to catch a glimpse of through the area railing.
She simply got up and followed her, with her mouth and eyes open, and without a word.
"Axed me if I was 'ungry," replied the hoarse voice.
She pulled the wreath off.
"I promised him I would bear it," she said.
And, somehow, Sara felt as if she understood her, though she said so little, and only stood still and looked and looked after her as she went out of the shop with the Indian gentleman, and they got into the carriage and drove away.
He had met with great misfortunes which had for a time so imperilled his whole fortune that he had thought himself ruined and disgraced forever.
It will seem as if we were more 'best friends' than ever." "Yes," answered Sara, nodding.
If he spoke of the school, I forgot--I forgot.
Sara knitted her brows a moment.
"Are you absolutely hardened?" The truth is that when one is still a child--or even if one is grown up--and has been well fed, and has slept long and softly and warm; when one has gone to sleep in the midst of a fairy story, and has wakened to find it real, one cannot be unhappy or even look as if one were; and one could not, if one tried, keep a glow of joy out of one's eyes.
"You may do anything you like to do, princess." "I was wondering," rather hesitated Sara--"you know, you say I have so much money--I was wondering if I could go to see the bun-woman, and tell her that if, when hungry children--particularly on those dreadful days--come and sit on the steps, or look in at the window, she would just call them in and give them something to eat, she might send the bills to me.
"Something's there, miss," she whispered.
We're--only--having a party." "So I see," said Miss Minchin, witheringly.
The next morning, Miss Minchin, in looking out of her window, saw the things she perhaps least enjoyed seeing.
At last he began to please himself with the thought of making her visions real things." "You think that it can be done while she sleeps?
She caught at the coal box and simply scuttled out of the room like a frightened rabbit.
There was, indeed, such a silence in the room at first that Ermengarde wondered if she could have fallen asleep.
An entire sixpence, he was sure, would mean affluence for evermore.
She taught the younger children French and heard their other lessons, and these were the least of her labors.
He thought I was queer, but he liked me to make up things.
And what I believe is that we always could--if we practiced enough.
Her show pupil had melted into nothingness, leaving only a friendless, beggared little girl.
It seemed to her many years since he had begun to prepare her mind for "the place," as she always called it.
She had had a long talk with Emily about her papa that morning.
"That didn't sound like Melchisedec," she said.
"His eyes look as if he would," Sara whispered back.
Perhaps you feel a little warm and comforted, and don't know why, when I am standing here in the cold and hoping you will get well and happy again.
What such an audacious look of well-being, under august displeasure could mean she could not understand.
So tonight, when I was crying under the bedclothes, I thought all at once of creeping up here and just begging you to let us be friends again." "You are nicer than I am," said Sara.
Carmichael was crying as she kissed her again.
She looked up into Monsieur Dufarge's face with her big, green-gray eyes, and they were quite innocently appealing.
"It is true that the first thought was mine, Sahib," he said; "though it was naught but a fancy.
It just HAPPENED that I always liked lessons and books, and could remember things when I learned them.
So it was natural that, having made Sara's acquaintance, she should sit and stare at her with profound admiration.
"But it is too short for her.
I love them--and I love them to be green--though they look black generally." "They are cat's eyes," laughed Sara; "but I can't see in the dark with them--because I have tried, and I couldn't--I wish I could." It was just at this minute that something happened at the skylight which neither of them saw.
The handsome, rosy man who was the father of the Large Family walked across the square in the most matter-of-fact manner, and ran up the steps of the next-door house.
That was why I gave him a name." She sat down on the floor in her favorite attitude, holding her knees.
"My dearest Sara!" Sara advanced a step toward her.
That evening, when the pupils were gathered together before the fire in the schoolroom, as was their custom before going to bed, Ermengarde came in with a letter in her hand and a queer expression on her round face.
She used to sit in the window-seat, huddled in a heap, and stare out of the window without speaking.
"I don't believe she would mind in the least.
"And mines with diamonds in 'em!" said the cook.
He was himself so well and happy, and so surrounded by cheerfulness and love, that desolation and broken health seemed pitifully unbearable things.
"You see, it's a kind of magic." Once, when she was relating the story of the search for Emily, Ermengarde saw her face suddenly change.
"I am so GLAD it was you who were my friend!" There never were such friends as these two became.
"I want your books--I want them!" And her eyes grew big, and her chest heaved.
She did--she did--like a little princess!" And her hysterics got the better of the poor woman, and she began to laugh and cry both at once, and rock herself backward and forward.
Nobody is responsible for her but you." "I am not responsible for her, and I refuse to be made responsible!" Miss Minchin became quite white with rage.
This was what would happen: when she was older she would be expected to drudge in the schoolroom as she drudged now in various parts of the house; they would be obliged to give her more respectable clothes, but they would be sure to be plain and ugly and to make her look somehow like a servant.
"You'd think they was made of crockery--but I know they ain't." "This is a carven flagon," said Sara, arranging tendrils of the wreath about the mug.
Almost immediately the door of the attic opened and Becky appeared.
Becky had told her about it.
I would have brought him back if it had not been so late.
"I wish she'd waken herself," Sara said.
It's a good thing not to answer your enemies.
Don't you want Sara for your mamma?" Lottie cuddled up to her with a consoled sniff.
"Miss Minchin's tables and chairs are just like her," she thought; "I remember thinking that the first minute I saw her, even though I was so little.
At such times stories were told by installments, things of a satisfying nature were either produced and eaten or hastily tucked into pockets to be disposed of at night, when Becky went upstairs to her attic to bed.
"You are a sharp child, and pick up things readily.
I did want to see the doll, miss, that I did.
They both heard the sound that checked her.
She could not have told herself or anyone else why there was a lump in her throat.
"There is a child there who interests me; but she is not a pupil.
A little drudge at the school." He waved his hand to Ram Dass, and addressed him.
Ermengarde was interested, as she always was.
It is full of good things.
But just before she reached the landing Miss Amelia came out of the door and closed it behind her, and stood before it, looking nervous and awkward.
Becky curtsied again, the tears openly streaming down her cheeks.
I've got so I don't mind 'em s' long as they don't run over my piller." "Ugh!" said Sara.
"What pains she has taken!
oh, miss!" she gasped; "I know it was you that asked her to let me come.
"Your monkey ran away again," she said, in her pretty voice.
I will go to Moscow." "If I were able to travel, I would go with you," said Carrisford; "but I can only sit here wrapped in furs and stare at the fire.
She was stronger than they were, even when they cut her head off." This was not a new thought, but quite an old one, by this time.
"It's a Splendid one," said Sara, softly, to herself.
"Why, she's in that there back room, miss, an' has been for a month; an' a decent, well-meanin' girl she's goin' to turn out, an' such a help to me in the shop an' in the kitchen as you'd scarce believe, knowin' how she's lived." She stepped to the door of the little back parlor and spoke; and the next minute a girl came out and followed her behind the counter.
"No, he wasn't really," he said.
Lottie actually dropped her legs, gave a wriggle, and lay and stared.
End of Project Gutenberg's A Little Princess, by Frances Hodgson Burnett
"Lavinia," with a new giggle, "what do you think Gertrude says?" "I don't know, I'm sure; and I don't care if it's something more about that everlasting Sara." "Well, it is.
He was really a very nice rat, and did not mean the least harm.
"Miss Ermengarde has asked you to come in," said Sara, "because she is going to bring a box of good things up here to us." Becky's cap almost fell off entirely, she broke in with such excitement.
To have impudently fallen asleep on such a young lady's chair!
But the thing must be done.
"Come along, monkey darling," she said.
Shortly afterward a doctor's carriage arrived, and the doctor went in--plainly to take care of him.
"She laughed a little, and she said I was a kind, kind little darling thing.
Indeed, she was very much pleased with her new little mistress and liked her place greatly.
I wish--I do wish--" She stopped short because her eyes at that instant fell upon something standing on a table in a corner.
During the last year the story of the diamond mines had suggested all sorts of possibilities to her.
If I could write poetry, I am sure a poem about 'A Last Doll' would be very nice.
And then she actually smiled--for what she saw she had never seen in the attic before, and knew she never should see.
"She's going to cry out loud," thought Ermengarde, fearfully.
"Could you suppose and pretend if you were a beggar and lived in a garret?" Sara stopped arranging the Last Doll's ostrich plumes, and looked thoughtful.
"He was one of the Large Family, the little one with the round legs--the one I call Guy Clarence.
Then she came to this fancy; and the next day, the Sahib being ill and wretched, I told him of the thing to amuse him.
She doesn't read them, Miss Minchin; she gobbles them up as if she were a little wolf instead of a little girl.
I believe I am as ugly as she is--in my way.
What does this mean?" "Kindly explain the matter, Carmichael," said the Indian gentleman; "and get it over as quickly as possible." And he made Sara sit down again, and held her hands in his--which was another trick of her papa's.
"It was as real as it was last night." "So was mine," said Sara.
Now watch!" She began to make a low, whistling sound--so low and coaxing that it could only have been heard in entire stillness.
He was such a pretty fellow and had such rosy cheeks and blue eyes, and such a darling little round head covered with curls, that Sara forgot her basket and shabby cloak altogether--in fact, forgot everything but that she wanted to look at him for a moment.
"At least I both want to slap you--and I should LIKE to slap you--but I WON'T slap you.
19 Anne Never had such joy reigned in the nursery of the Large Family.

Never in her dull, short life had Miss St.
But I cannot write poetry.
"We call her the little un-fairy princess." "Why?" the Indian gentleman inquired, because the fancies of the Large Family always made him forget things a little.
Oh, Sara, please tell me.
The Indian gentleman had never had a companion he liked quite as much as he liked Sara.
"There she is, with that horrid child!" exclaimed Lavinia in a whisper.
She rubbed her eyes with her handkerchief until they looked quite red.
She knows that stories belong to everybody." "I thought," retorted Lavinia, in severe recollection, "that your mamma was dead.
Carmichael looked at him uneasily.
Then a thought came back to her which made the color rise in her cheek and a spark light itself in her eyes.
"Are you--are you very unhappy?" she said in a rush.
She must not awaken from this delight--she must be quite still and make it last.
"I suppose soldiers feel like this when they are on a long and weary march," she often said to herself.
"The Princess sat on the white rock and watched them." It was a wonderful story about a princess who was loved by a Prince Merman, and went to live with him in shining caves under the sea.
"Nor yet no bre'fast--nor yet no supper.
She saw herself burdened with an extravagantly brought-up child whom she had always resented, and she lost all self-control.
"Is that--" she ventured, looking longingly at the rose-colored frock.
When Sara entered the room, Lottie was lying upon the floor, screaming and kicking her small fat legs violently, and Miss Amelia was bending over her in consternation and despair, looking quite red and damp with heat.
"He IS plain-looking, miss, ain't he?" said Becky.
"Oh, there's Melchisedec, poor thing.
"What are you thinking of?" she demanded.
She could even go and pay bills, and she combined with this the ability to dust a room well and to set things in order.
"Wake up!" When Becky wakened, and she sat upright staring aghast, her face still smudged with traces of tears, beside her stood a little figure in a luxurious wadded robe of crimson silk.
You know, it makes people angry to be taken for beggars when they are not beggars." "She wasn't angry," said Donald, a trifle dismayed, but still firm.
She felt as if she had lived a long, long time.
Mariette broke forth into a flow of description.
Ram Dass knew him as if he were his child, and Ram Dass he would sometimes obey, but not always.
She looked as if she were going to box her ears.
But, as it was, she felt a flush rising on her cheeks.
"She is a darling little creature.
"I am NOT--I am NOT dreaming!" She almost staggered to the books and opened the one which lay upon the top.
Her eyes and nose were pink with crying.
"There are many in the walls." "Ugh!" exclaimed the young man.
"You impudent, dishonest child!" they heard her say.
All the things look rather grand.
"Oh, Sara!" cried Lottie, cuddling in her guarding arm.
"Come, come," he said in his cheery voice; "we'll find her yet." "We must begin at once.
Of course there were several long and tiresome errands to be done--there always were on days like this--and Sara was sent out again and again, until her shabby clothes were damp through.
After which she got up and went out of the room, without venturing to say another word.
There's a mug on the wash-stand, Becky.
She just picked it up, because she always heard her papa speak it.
"Just on the other side of the wall." 18 "I Tried Not to Be" It was pretty, comfortable Mrs.
"I dare say you could live without me, Sara; but I couldn't live without you.
You are stuffed with sawdust.
I am so sorry for you," she would whisper in an intense little voice.
"Sahib," he had said one day, "I could cross the slates and make the child a fire when she is out on some errand.
They made not the least noise until they reached the door.
She had put on, without Mariette's help, the cast-aside black-velvet frock.
Emily looked so like a real child that Captain Crewe felt glad she was there.
She used to put her in a chair sometimes and sit opposite to her on the old red footstool, and stare and pretend about her until her own eyes would grow large with something which was almost like fear--particularly at night when everything was so still, when the only sound in the attic was the occasional sudden scurry and squeak of Melchisedec's family in the wall.
She knew what had happened, but, somehow, she had never imagined Sara could look like this--so odd and poor and almost like a servant.
"I was a-'pretendin',' miss," she answered a little sheepishly; "I was tryin' to see it like you do.
It was perhaps in making his salute to her that he loosened his hold on the monkey.
I believe I will begin pretending I am one." Becky stared at her admiringly, and, as before, did not understand her in the least.
Put your box down." Becky obeyed with alarmed haste and hastily backed toward the door.
It was, indeed, well for her that as she lay awake in the darkness her mind was forcibly distracted, now and then, by the strangeness of her surroundings.
"Diamond mines!" he broke out.
"You impudent creature!" she said.
The glimpse Sara caught of her sitting room, as she passed its open door, showed her that everything had been changed.
"A black frock?" Miss Amelia stammered again.
Several of the Montmorencys were evidently going to a children's party, and just as Sara was about to pass the door they were crossing the pavement to get into the carriage which was waiting for them.
She had seen other children go away, and had heard their fathers and mothers talk about the letters they received from them.
When she had been the Princess Sara, driving through the streets in her brougham, or walking, attended by Mariette, the sight of her bright, eager little face and picturesque coats and hats had often caused people to look after her.
"We'll all be as quiet as mice." "Mice don't make a noise like that," said Janet.
"Diamond mines spell ruin oftener than they spell wealth," said Mr.
"Suppose it was a magic bun," she said, "and a bite was as much as a whole dinner.
And there are walls made of pearl and gold all round the city, but they are low enough for the people to go and lean on them, and look down onto the earth and smile, and send beautiful messages." Whatsoever story she had begun to tell, Lottie would, no doubt, have stopped crying, and been fascinated into listening; but there was no denying that this story was prettier than most others.
"It's like a real party!" cried Ermengarde.
"She does look an object.
It was like two distinct knocks on the wall.
"None mount here but herself, Sahib," he said.
"I have done everything for her.
That young man had too much money.
The French master, Monsieur Dufarge, will be here in a few minutes.
"Which hungry day was it?" "I forgot you didn't know," said Sara.
"The wicked, cruel thing!" she burst forth.
She discovered that she said the same thing to each papa and mamma who brought a child to her school.
I am giving her a home, and that is more than she has any right to expect from me." Sara did not expect much, and was far too proud to try to continue to be intimate with girls who evidently felt rather awkward and uncertain about her.
He knew that this young human being sitting on the red footstool would not jump up and terrify him with wild, sharp noises or throw heavy objects at him which, if they did not fall and crush him, would send him limping in his scurry back to his hole.
"I don't know anyone in the world who could have done it," she said; "but there has been someone.
Some of Lottie's crumbs had dropped upon the floor and their scent had drawn him out of his hole.
To tell the truth, she was quite glad to find it there.
"I will leave you to wonder," she said.
Barrow evidently did not intend to remain to listen to the story of Miss Minchin's grievances after he had made the position of his firm clear and related the mere dry facts.
It was she who decided when it was discreet to ask the Indian gentleman to tell stories about India, and it was she who saw when he was tired and it was the time to steal quietly away and tell Ram Dass to go to him.
He stayed inside quite a long time, and several times came out and gave directions to the workmen, as if he had a right to do so.
He only knew that the men were invading the silence and privacy of the attic; and as the one with the dark face let himself down through the aperture with such lightness and dexterity that he did not make the slightest sound, Melchisedec turned tail and fled precipitately back to his hole.
While I was dressing I ate some of the cold things we left." "Oh, laws!
Carrisford, madam," he said, "was an intimate friend of the late Captain Crewe.
She tucked her feet under her nightgown and the red shawl.
She found beautiful new flowers growing in her room, whimsical little gifts tucked under pillows, and once, as they sat together in the evening, they heard the scratch of a heavy paw on the door, and when Sara went to find out what it was, there stood a great dog--a splendid Russian boarhound--with a grand silver and gold collar bearing an inscription.
"The spirit and will of any other child would have been entirely humbled and broken by--by the changes she has had to submit to.
"Is it anything to do with the row that has been going on?" said Lavinia, eagerly.
Carrisford?" turning to the Indian gentleman.
She could at least stop this.
There's nothing so strong as rage, except what makes you hold it in--that's stronger.
"When you come to cheer an ill person up you don't cheer him up at the top of your voice.
As she had not found a piece of black ribbon, her short, thick, black hair tumbled loosely about her face and contrasted strongly with its pallor.
The servants knew that she was allowed to stay because Miss Minchin could not easily find another creature helpless and humble enough to work like a bounden slave for so few shillings a week.
Never did she find anything so difficult as to keep herself from losing her temper when she was suddenly disturbed while absorbed in a book.
"What IS she crying for?" she almost yelled.
When she entered the room, she floated in with a few of the butterfly steps--and there sat Becky, nodding her cap sideways off her head.
He trusted his friend too much." The Indian gentleman's breath came more quickly.
I shall feel as if they were friends, even if a head never looks out of the attic window." When she was taking in the evening's milk for the cook (there was really no odd job she was not called upon to do), she saw something occur which made the situation more interesting than ever.
Then it was Sara's turn again.
Sometimes, when she passed a shop window with a mirror in it, she almost laughed outright on catching a glimpse of herself, and sometimes her face went red and she bit her lip and turned away.
"He'll think I've read them." Sara put down her book and shook her head slowly.
"You didn't want to talk to me.
The face she saw was a shining, wonderful thing.
Such a person, however, would be sure to be crotchety and hot-tempered enough to be easily offended.
"There is nothing to steal--" She broke off in the middle of her words.
The jungle fever might not have killed him if he had not been driven mad by the business troubles, and the business troubles might not have put an end to him if the jungle fever had not assisted.
You will have something to remember.
Help me." On the other side of the wall Sara was sitting in her garret talking to Melchisedec, who had come out for his evening meal.
You can get a good deal out of her as she grows older." "I will get a good deal out of her before she grows older!" exclaimed Miss Minchin.
Will you not do your duty to your poor papa and come home with me?" Sara took a step toward her and stood still.
She ran to the table, and picking up the top volume, turned over its leaves quickly.
"I said four, if you please," she explained.
"There are fields and fields of flowers," she said, forgetting herself, as usual, when she began, and talking rather as if she were in a dream, "fields and fields of lilies--and when the soft wind blows over them it wafts the scent of them into the air--and everybody always breathes it, because the soft wind is always blowing.
At four o'clock in the afternoon, even when there was no special fog, the daylight was at an end.
Really, it was hard for the child to climb the three long flights of stairs leading to her attic.
I will!" Sara went to them quietly.
"What do you mean?" "At any rate," answered Mr.
Sara's rooms she had saved until the last.
Her face went red and then it went pale, and for a second she felt as if she could not take the dear little sixpence.
If there was a war he would have to bear marching and thirstiness and, perhaps, deep wounds.
I felt it my duty"--priggishly.
"As to answering, though," said Sara, trying to console herself, "I don't answer very often.
She was a fat child who did not look as if she were in the least clever, but she had a good-naturedly pouting mouth.
If this had not been so, the anguish of her young mind might have been too great for a child to bear.
His hand dropped from Mr.
Becky's heart told her that it was best that people in trouble should be left alone.
Would you like to hold her?" "Oh, may I?" said Ermengarde.
She looked at the first page with a grave face.
Her hair was heavy and quite black and only curled at the tips; her eyes were greenish gray, it is true, but they were big, wonderful eyes with long, black lashes, and though she herself did not like the color of them, many other people did.
How is a man to get back his nerve with a thing like that on his mind?
Certain events have increased it enormously.
"Advance, fair damsels," she said in her happy dream-voice, "and be seated at the banquet table.
"It makes me feel as if someone had hit me," Sara had told Ermengarde once in confidence.
There is a little child who comes to her in secret; there is one older who worships her and would listen to her forever if she might.
I am quite poor." "You are a beggar," said Miss Minchin, her temper rising at the recollection of what all this meant.
Put a stop to this ridiculous party of hers.
Go and play with Ram Dass." Then the door opened and he came in.
Ah, indeed, Mademoiselle Sara might well ask.
Do you hear--papa is dead?
An' there was one everyone stared at most.
She could not help it.
When the cab drove away from the door, Sara was sitting on the floor of her sitting room, with her hands under her chin and her eyes following it until it had turned the corner of the square.
"Yes," said Sara, her eyes growing shocked and large in her small white face.
Wonderful rugs and draperies and ornaments were taken from the vans, many pictures, and books enough for a library.
She does not like me; though perhaps it is my fault, because I do not like her." But, oddly enough, Miss Minchin made it unnecessary for Mr.
"I can move as if my feet were of velvet," Ram Dass replied; "and children sleep soundly--even the unhappy ones.
If she is alive, she is somewhere.
Suppose she should!" 12 The Other Side of the Wall When one lives in a row of houses, it is interesting to think of the things which are being done and said on the other side of the wall of the very rooms one is living in.
I think them over afterward." The truth was that she had saved herself annoyance several times by keeping her eye on Lavinia, who was quite ready to make mischief, and would have been rather pleased to have made it for the ex-show pupil.
"I was always so sure of his payments that I went to all sorts of ridiculous expenses for the child.
Take great care of her for me, Miss Minchin." Sara stayed with her father at his hotel for several days; in fact, she remained with him until he sailed away again to India.
The first time it occurred to her to bring home two or three little meat pies, she felt that she had hit upon a discovery.
"I arst yer pardon, miss!
I don't believe we can keep her." But she crept out of the room, and was very much relieved to find an excuse for doing it.
Captain Crewe is dead!" Miss Minchin dropped into her chair again.
She would have liked to believe or pretend to believe that Emily understood and sympathized with her.
Barrow, quite snappishly, "it would have been much better if there never had been any." "Any diamond mines?" ejaculated Miss Minchin, catching at the back of a chair and feeling as if a splendid dream was fading away from her.
She will think I am in bed.
She has only the old black velvet, and she has outgrown it." "Go and tell her to take off that preposterous pink silk gauze, and put the black one on, whether it is too short or not.
"But there is no little girl." All three of them incontinently fled from the room and tumbled into the hall.
There was no mistake about it.
"You are NOT kind, and it is NOT a home." And she had turned and run out of the room before Miss Minchin could stop her or do anything but stare after her with stony anger.
I'd do 'em that quick--if you'd let me wait on her now she's poor.
She lifted her little savage hand and knocked Emily off the chair, bursting into a passion of sobbing--Sara who never cried.
I like it so, it--it makes me feel sorrowful." But the next moment she was mystified.
"They fill all the air with perfume.
Having wept hopeless tears for weeks in her efforts to remember that "la mere" meant "the mother," and "le pere," "the father,"--when one spoke sensible English--it was almost too much for her suddenly to find herself listening to a child her own age who seemed not only quite familiar with these words, but apparently knew any number of others, and could mix them up with verbs as if they were mere trifles.
"How--how are you?" "I don't know," Sara replied.
"I shall die presently," she said at first.
"It makes me feel almost afraid--as if something strange was just going to happen.
"Go home at once," she commanded indignantly.
"Don't be frightened," she said, quite as if she had been speaking to a little girl like herself.
Then the dear friend ran away--Captain Crewe was already stricken with fever when the news came.
And from that time forward, it may be mentioned, the elder Miss Minchin actually began to stand a little in awe of a sister who, while she looked so foolish, was evidently not quite so foolish as she looked, and might, consequently, break out and speak truths people did not want to hear.
"Found out what?" "That I really was a princess," said Sara, "and could do anything--anything I liked." Every pair of eyes in the room widened to its full limit.
And set traps for me, and pretend they were dinner.
What wouldn't I give to have her little arms round my neck this minute!
"I dare say you can eat them sometime.
Her dear mamma, who had died when she was born, had been French.
I must look among the things in the old trunk I had when I was a princess." She flew to its corner and kneeled down.
What steps shall I take next?" When Sara went into the house she met Miss Minchin, who had come downstairs to scold the cook.
The sparrows always seemed to her to twitter with a sort of subdued softness just when these marvels were going on.
"Do you think--you COULD?" she ejaculated.
To be invited into a warm place full of bread seemed an incredible thing.
"A vast chamber where feasts are given.
"She will wait on herself, and on other people, too.
He had evidently not fully recovered from some very severe illness.
She did not know how long she slept.
She glanced from one figure to the other.
That night, when she went to her room, after she and Becky had eaten their supper she sat and looked at the fire seriously for a long time.
"I'm very sorry," she said.
Several times she had found that she could not think of a satisfactory reply when she was dealing with Sara.
"No dinner," more hoarsely still and with more shuffling.
The Magic always arranged that kind of thing in one way or another.
I have short black hair and green eyes; besides which, I am a thin child and not fair in the least.
"Come and sit in the window-seat with me," Sara went on, "and I'll whisper a story to you." "Will you?" whimpered Lottie.
"Yes; a rat, Sahib," answered Ram Dass, also whispering.
I like her best then.
"Are you hungry?" she asked.
"How soft and thick it is!" she said, with the little laugh which Becky knew the meaning of; and she raised and set her foot down again delicately, as if she felt something under it.
"Better keep her and make use of her," he added.
"She is a kind of servant at the seminary," Janet said.
The law will interfere in my behalf." "Come, come, Miss Minchin," Mr.
She looked very much moved, and suddenly took Sara in her arms and kissed her.
And when night came Sara always heard the humble knock at her door which meant that her handmaid was ready to help her again if she was needed.
The afternoons in which the Large Family, or Ermengarde and Lottie, gathered to rejoice together were very delightful.
She could actually FEEL blankets, and when she put out her hand it touched something exactly like a satin-covered eider-down quilt.
Sometimes they made islands or great mountains enclosing lakes of deep turquoise-blue, or liquid amber, or chrysoprase-green; sometimes dark headlands jutted into strange, lost seas; sometimes slender strips of wonderful lands joined other wonderful lands together.
Once or twice she even heard sharp-toed feet scurrying across the floor, and she remembered in those after days, when she recalled things, that when first she heard them she started up in bed and sat trembling, and when she lay down again covered her head with the bedclothes.
"It might almost be called defiance," answered Miss Minchin, feeling annoyed because she knew the thing she resented was nothing like defiance, and she did not know what other unpleasant term to use.
"It is Sara's fortune now, in fact.
You shall have neither breakfast, dinner, nor supper!" "I have not had either dinner or supper today, Miss Minchin," said Sara, rather faintly.
He only thought he had lost it; and because he loved him so much his grief made him so ill that for a time he was not in his right mind.
Then, somehow, it was quite possible that any place in which Sara lived might turn out to be nice.
"Yes, I should like to see her.
Sara saw that privately she could not help hoping very much that they would all be black, and would wear turbans, and, above all, that--like their parent--they would all be "'eathens." "I never lived next door to no 'eathens, miss," she said; "I should like to see what sort o' ways they'd have." It was several weeks before her curiosity was satisfied, and then it was revealed that the new occupant had neither wife nor children.
They were very fond of Ram Dass.
"Left just one for herself," she said in a low voice.
"You have been out for hours." "It was so wet and muddy," Sara answered, "it was hard to walk, because my shoes were so bad and slipped about." "Make no excuses," said Miss Minchin, "and tell no falsehoods." Sara went in to the cook.
Her pronunciation made even Monsieur Dufarge smile in spite of himself, and Lavinia and Jessie and the more fortunate girls either giggled or looked at her in wondering disdain.
Carmichael interposed, "the law will do nothing of the sort.
She remembered stories of the French Revolution which Sara had been able to fix in her mind by her dramatic relation of them.
Miss Minchin could not understand why I did my exercises so well that first morning." Sara laughed a little and hugged her knees.
"Things happen to people by accident," she used to say.
"I am sorry for the friend," Janet said; "I can't help it.
"I wish we could be 'best friends.' Would you have me for yours?
The rug was laid down already.
"He has crept out of the Lascar's attic, and he saw the light." Becky ran to her side.
Faces used to appear at the nursery windows when she passed, and many discussions concerning her were held round the fire.
"That is my part," she said.
There was no one who would have understood.
You see, if people knew that dolls could do things, they would make them work.
But I didn't listen, mum--I wouldn't for nothin'.
"I wish she could talk," she said to herself.
"He came to my garret window last night, and I took him in because it was so cold.
Frequently at this hour she could see the gentleman she called Mr.
They're so queer." She paused a moment, and then added with a touch of awe in her voice, "You are CLEVER, aren't you?" Sara looked out of the window into the dingy square, where the sparrows were hopping and twittering on the wet, iron railings and the sooty branches of the trees.
"My, ain't it lovely!" whispered Becky.
"It has been harder than usual.
How the morning passed nobody quite knew, because there seemed such preparations to be made.
It was an odd sound like a queer little squeaky chattering.
He looked at her with his bright eyes, as if he were asking a question.
She knew what they meant, because Becky had described them.
Then she went back to Sara.
He was the owner of a large tract of land upon which diamonds had been found, and he was engaged in developing the mines.
"Adversity tries people, and mine has tried you and proved how nice you are." 9 Melchisedec The third person in the trio was Lottie.
"Oh, I never had such a dream before." She scarcely dared to stir; but at last she pushed the bedclothes aside, and put her feet on the floor with a rapturous smile.
"Get your coverlet and wrap it round you, and I'll get mine, and we will huddle close together on the bed, and I'll tell you about the tropical forest where the Indian gentleman's monkey used to live.
"It has been hard to be a princess today, Melchisedec," she said.
"Other people have lived in worse places.
The card, miss," rather doubtfully; "'t warn't wrong of me to pick it up out o' the dust-bin, was it?
She had lived such a life of imaginings that she was quite equal to accepting any wonderful thing that happened, and almost to cease, in a short time, to find it bewildering.
And there's nothing so clever in her knowing it.
"You were half delirious already.
She domineered over the little children, and assumed grand airs with those big enough to be her companions.
The mere presence of plump, comfortable Ermengarde, wrapped in her red shawl, would warm it a little.
Sometimes they nodded to each other in passing, but there were times when they did not even exchange a greeting.
In the evening, when she passed houses whose windows were lighted up, she used to look into the warm rooms and amuse herself by imagining things about the people she saw sitting before the fires or about the tables.
The cook was in too vicious a humor to give her anything to eat with it.
A number of new things had been brought into the attic which so altered the look of it that if she had not been past doubting she would have rubbed her eyes.
Come and sit on this footstool near my knee, and only remember you are a princess." "Yes," said Sara, smiling; "and I can give buns and bread to the populace." And she went and sat on the stool, and the Indian gentleman (he used to like her to call him that, too, sometimes) drew her small dark head down on his knee and stroked her hair.
"I am not in the least anxious about her education," Captain Crewe said, with his gay laugh, as he held Sara's hand and patted it.
To be kind is worth a great deal to other people.
"He was ill as my papa was; but he did not die." So her heart was more drawn to him than before.
"I should be telling a story if I said she was beautiful," she thought; "and I should know I was telling a story.
If--if, oh please, would you let me wait on her after I've done my pots an' kettles?
Several times it so happened that Sara had an opportunity of seeing things carried in.
She knew that if a policeman chanced to see her he would tell her to "move on." Sara clutched her little fourpenny piece and hesitated for a few seconds.
But for me she should have starved in the streets." Here the Indian gentleman lost his temper.
"Someone in the family MUST have been in India," Sara thought.
She would have seen exactly the same face pressed against the glass and peering in at her as it had peered in earlier in the evening when she had been talking to Ermengarde.
Sara always said something queer, and never seemed the least bit frightened.
When Miss Minchin sent her sister, Miss Amelia, to see what the child was doing, she found she could not open the door.
She was so startled that she was almost frightened.
Something happened for a time, and Mr.
She was a slim, supple creature, rather tall for her age, and had an intense, attractive little face.
"But I don't believe in mines full of diamonds." "Well, people have to get them from somewhere," said Jessie.
"Yes," she said, hugging her knees, "that will be a good place to pretend about.
Except for Lottie's angry screams, the room was quite quiet.
If she had been older, Miss Minchin would have given her the bigger girls to teach and saved money by dismissing an instructress; but while she remained and looked like a child, she could be made more useful as a sort of little superior errand girl and maid of all work.
John gave another jump, and when Lavinia and Jessie tittered she became redder than ever--so red, indeed, that she almost looked as if tears were coming into her poor, dull, childish eyes; and Sara saw her and was so sorry for her that she began rather to like her and want to be her friend.
Ram Dass told me of this child's miseries, and together we invented a romantic plan to help her.
Sara sat upon the hearth-rug and told her strange things.
"It's a good place to pretend in." The truth was that Ermengarde did not know anything of the sometimes almost unbearable side of life in the attic and she had not a sufficiently vivid imagination to depict it for herself.
They had little chance to speak to each other during the day.
Lavinia was telling the truth." So they knew that it was Lavinia who had somehow guessed their secret and had betrayed them.
"Captain Crewe is a man of fortune," she said.
"What am I to do?" "There isn't anything to do," said Mr.
"Barrow & Skipworth are not responsible for anything.
When she awakened it was rather suddenly, and she did not know that any particular thing had called her out of her sleep.
"Look at your book again." And Sara did so, and did not smile, even when she found that "le fils" meant "the son," and "le frere" meant "the brother." "When Monsieur Dufarge comes," she thought, "I can make him understand." Monsieur Dufarge arrived very shortly afterward.
"It is so close that if there was a little girl in the attic, we could talk to each other through the windows and climb over to see each other, if we were not afraid of falling." The sky seemed so much nearer than when one saw it from the street, that Lottie was enchanted.
"The suffering was just as bad for my papa," she said.
Carrisford is better already," he said.
Her short legs had seemed to have been mounting hundreds of stairs.
After him there descended a nurse in uniform, then came down the steps two men-servants.
Until the new pupil's arrival, she had felt herself the leader in the school.
"You ARE queer--but you are nice." "I know I am queer," admitted Sara, cheerfully; "and I TRY to be nice." She rubbed her forehead with her little brown paw, and a puzzled, tender look came into her face.
"Are you as poor as a beggar?" She thrust a fat hand into the slim one and opened round, tearful eyes.
"Yes, miss," answered Becky, watching her with serious rapture.
"What an original child!" she said.
"What are you going to tell your father?" she asked, a slight doubt dawning in her mind.
"What sort of things?" demanded Lottie, with that curiosity Sara could always awaken even in bigger girls.
You can have them, poor thing!
That very evening, as Sara was sitting in the midst of a group of listeners in a corner of the schoolroom telling one of her stories, the very same figure timidly entered the room, carrying a coal box much too heavy for her, and knelt down upon the hearth rug to replenish the fire and sweep up the ashes.
She was interested and looked back quietly at the children who looked at her.
It was a little writing-case fitted with paper and envelopes and pens and ink.
They bought, indeed, a great many more things than Sara needed; but Captain Crewe was a rash, innocent young man and wanted his little girl to have everything she admired and everything he admired himself, so between them they collected a wardrobe much too grand for a child of seven.
But he spoke to Miss Minchin.
"Do you think I am very happy?" And she marched past her without another word.
She used to see through us both--" "Amelia!" gasped her infuriated elder, looking as if she would box her ears and knock her cap off, as she had often done to Becky.
"I wish I had some crumbs to throw to him." "I have some!" came in a little shriek from Lottie.
Hadn't we better be quick?" And she hastily crammed her sandwich into her mouth.
'I have something to communicate.'" Five quick knocks answered her.
Ermengarde thought she looked as if she were working a spell.
"And she had beautiful floating blonde hair; and when I think of her, I never see her head on her body, but always on a pike, with those furious people dancing and howling." It was agreed that Mr.
He looks as if he were asking me a question.
The loud, sobbing sniff was heard again, and she stooped and raised the hanging folds of the table cover.
There were eight children in the Large Family, and a stout, rosy mother, and a stout, rosy father, and a stout, rosy grandmother, and any number of servants.
But it was very odd to find herself expected to study a page which told her that "le pere" meant "the father," and "la mere" meant "the mother." Miss Minchin glanced toward her scrutinizingly.
Added to this, she had been deprived of her dinner, because Miss Minchin had chosen to punish her.
"No one is anywhere about," she explained.
"You can hang things on them," he said.
She must remain where she was, and Mr.
When she was sent out at night she used sometimes to feel quite glad, because there was always a chance that the curtains of the house next door might not yet be closed and she could look into the warm room and see her adopted friend.
There was some comfort in that.
"Will there be ice everywhere?" "Shall you drive in a drosky?" cried another.
The excitement of the totally unexpected discovery had been temporarily almost overpowering to Mr.
"It is the monkey," she cried out.
"Suppose there was a comfortable chair before it--and suppose there was a small table near, with a little hot--hot supper on it.
The diamond mines have retrieved themselves." "The diamond mines!" Miss Minchin gasped out.
They were warm and full-fed and happy, and it was just like Sara that, having found her strange good fortune real, she should give herself up to the enjoyment of it to the utmost.
"Did you expect me to keep it hot for you?" Sara stood silent for a second.
May I try, Miss Minchin?" "If you can, you are a clever child," answered Miss Minchin, drawing in her mouth sharply.
And he died thinking I had ruined him--I--Tom Carrisford, who played cricket at Eton with him.
Shabby, poorly dressed children are not rare enough and pretty enough to make people turn around to look at them and smile.
Each had her own tasks to perform, and any attempt at conversation would have been regarded as a tendency to loiter and lose time.
"So does my mamma--'cept Sara is my mamma at Miss Minchin's--my other one knows everything.
From the kitchen windows one could not see them at all, and could only guess that they were going on because the bricks looked warm and the air rosy or yellow for a while, or perhaps one saw a blazing glow strike a particular pane of glass somewhere.
The next morning she left this on the little table, and in the evening it had been taken away with the other things; so she knew the Magician had received it, and she was happier for the thought.
When she was gone Sara sat on her favorite perch on the end of her table.
She could be sent on errands at any time and in all weathers.
"There wouldn't be any use in trying.
"Who planned it?" Ram Dass made a modestly apologetic obeisance.
She was screaming and dancing up and down in the midst of a group of friends and enemies, who were alternately coaxing and scolding her.
That was my idea--to search London." "There are schools enough in London," said Mr.
Sara sat on his knee and held the lapels of his coat in her small hands, and looked long and hard at his face.
Sara hesitated a second before she replied.
"I--TRIED not to be anything else," she answered in a low voice--"even when I was coldest and hungriest--I tried not to be." "Now it will not be necessary to try," said Miss Minchin, acidly, as Ram Dass salaamed her out of the room.
At first Ermengarde was too much alarmed to do anything but huddle in a heap upon the bed and tuck up her feet, but the sight of Sara's composed little countenance and the story of Melchisedec's first appearance began at last to rouse her curiosity, and she leaned forward over the edge of the bed and watched Sara go and kneel down by the hole in the skirting board.
The two had always been friends, but Sara had felt as if she were years the older.
The greater number of her evenings she was supposed to spend at study, and at various indefinite intervals she was examined and knew she would have been severely admonished if she had not advanced as was expected of her.
"Besides," she said, "he is a Bastille rat sent to be my friend.
Carmichael felt rather restless, and he rose and began to pace the room with a thoughtful, though uncertain face.
11 Ram Dass There were fine sunsets even in the square, sometimes.
She had certainly a very intelligent expression in her eyes when Sara took her in her arms.
"Why does she say I am a beautiful child?" she was thinking.
He lay close and flat near the entrance of his home, just managing to peep through the crack with a bright, alarmed eye.
God bless you!" And he ran down the steps and jumped into the brougham.
If the children were not attentive, if they talked, if they were restless, it was she who would be reproved.
"I wonder who the little girl is," she thought--"the little girl he is going to look for." And she went down the area steps, lugging her basket and finding it very heavy indeed, as the father of the Large Family drove quickly on his way to the station to take the train which was to carry him to Moscow, where he was to make his best efforts to search for the lost little daughter of Captain Crewe.
She spoke to herself aloud without knowing that she was doing it.
I've been practicing a good deal lately, and it's beginning to be easier than it used to be.
"Next door," said Ermengarde, "with the Indian gentleman." "Where?
But you have to bite your tongue to hold yourself in.
She felt too sleepy and--curiously enough--too warm and comfortable.
She did not cry now.
The schoolroom was being decked with garlands of holly; the desks had been moved away, and red covers had been put on the forms which were arrayed round the room against the wall.
You ought to be fondest of your own family; and I'm not a REAL relation." And when she went to bed she made him a nest at her feet, and he curled up and slept there as if he were a baby and much pleased with his quarters.
He called her his 'Little Missus.' But the wretched mines drove everything else out of our heads.
"Did you find it?" "Yes," said Sara.
But she had been tired enough to sleep deeply and profoundly--too deeply and soundly to be disturbed by anything, even by the squeaks and scamperings of Melchisedec's entire family, if all his sons and daughters had chosen to come out of their hole to fight and tumble and play.
"Would you like to see Emily?" she inquired.
Perhaps I'm a HIDEOUS child, and no one will ever know, just because I never have any trials." "Lavinia has no trials," said Ermengarde, stolidly, "and she is horrid enough." Sara rubbed the end of her little nose reflectively, as she thought the matter over.
"I know she won't mind it.
"What'll we set it with?" Sara looked round the attic, too.
It was found that she could be made use of in numberless directions.
The touch of the soft, slim little paw on her shoulder was the most amazing thing she had ever known.
"I know I shall--if I'm found out." she said.
"The fire was THERE", pointing with her finger, "an' the table was before it; an' the lamp was there, an' the light looked rosy red; an' there was a satin cover on your bed, an' a warm rug on the floor, an' everythin' looked beautiful; an'"--she paused a second, and laid her hand on her stomach tenderly--"there WAS soup an' sandwiches an' muffins--there WAS." And, with this conviction a reality at least, she went away.
"I could 'ave e't two of 'em," they heard her cry into her pillow.
"He gets hungry and frightened, just as we do; and he is married and has children.
"But if you cry, you will be one, Lottie pet.
Her home for the future will be with me." Miss Minchin fell back in amazed indignation.
She did not wish that you should go to sleep unhappy.
It was a cold afternoon, Melchisedec.
I am sure it would break his heart." "You are an understanding little woman, Janet," the Indian gentleman said, and he held her hand close.
He is kind and good, and he was sorry for you, for little lost Sara Crewe's sake." The library door opened and Mr.
"'Dear Sara must speak French to Lady Pitkin.
"You see," Sara said when they were examining one who had no clothes.
The streets are shining, and there are fields and fields of lilies, and everybody gathers them.
It contained a dozen small white handkerchiefs.
Miss Minchin came into the room, accompanied by a sharp-featured, dry little gentleman, who looked rather disturbed.
It gets harder as the weather grows colder and the streets get more sloppy.
