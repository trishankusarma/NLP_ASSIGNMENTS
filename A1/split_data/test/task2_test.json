    "thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me. \u201cThere was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up and found they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who",
    "Opening it, Grace found nothing save a dilapidated old coat. Just then she caught the sound of rough voices just outside the cottage. \"I tell ye, Bill, we've got to do the job to-night and hike for the West on that train that goes through Oakdale at 3.15 in the morning,\" said a voice that was almost a growl. \"I'm wid yer, Jim,\" answered another voice in correspondingly savage tones. \"Even to layin' a few out stiff if dey gets in de way.\" Grace listened. She heard heavy footsteps, and, peeping into the room, she saw a burly figure outlined in the front door in the act of entering. She glanced toward the back door. It was closed and fastened with a bolt. If she could slip out that way, she could make a run for the picnic grounds, but she dared not try to pass the two men who had just appeared. The few words of their conversation proved them to be lawless. Noiselessly she slipped into the closet and drew the door almost shut. She would hide until they had gone. They were not likely to linger long in the cottage. Minute after minute went by, but the intruders showed no signs of leaving. \"What shall I do?\" Grace breathed, wringing her hands. \"They're real, downright burglars of the worst sort, and they're planning a robbery. It's getting late, too, and the girls will soon be going back. Oh, I must get out of here, but I won't try to go until I find out whose house they're going to rob.\" The men talked on, but, listen as she might, Grace could get no clue. \"There ain't a soul on the joint except the judge and one old servant,\"",

I staid down there an hour, and surprised the workmen when they hauled up and found a man on the rope instead of a bucket of rock. I walked home, too\u2014five miles\u2014up hill. We had no school report next morning; but the _Union_ had. Six months after my entry into journalism the grand \u201cflush times\u201d of Silverland began, and they continued with unabated splendor for three years. All difficulty about filling up the \u201clocal department\u201d ceased, and the only trouble now was how to make the lengthened columns hold the world of incidents and happenings that came to our literary net every day. Virginia had grown to be the \u201clivest\u201d town, for its age and population, that America had ever produced. The sidewalks swarmed with people\u2014to such an extent, indeed, that it was generally no easy matter to stem the human tide. The streets themselves were just as crowded with quartz wagons, freight teams and other vehicles. The procession was endless. So great was the pack, that buggies frequently had to wait half an hour for an opportunity to cross the principal street. Joy sat on every countenance, and there was a glad, almost fierce, intensity in every eye, that told of the money-getting schemes that were seething",
    "on you, but you won't ruin so many of us. It is better for one to suffer than for all to suffer. You won't tell, will you, Ruth?\" Ruth made no reply in words. The great bell rang, the doors of the school were flung wide, and the girls, Ruth amongst them, entered. CHAPTER XXVII. AFTER THE FUN COMES THE DELUGE Kathleen O'Hara's nature was of the kind that rises to the top of the mountains and sinks again to the lowest vales. She had been on the tip-top of the hills of her own fantasy all that evening. When she ran quickly home under the stars she began to realize what she had done She had done something of which her mother would have been ashamed. Not for a moment had Kathleen thought of this way of looking at her escapade until she read the truth in the eyes of the unknown but most kind lady. She despised herself for her own action, but she did not dread discovery. It did not occur to her as possible that what she and her companions had done could be known. If no one knew, no one need be at all more sorry or at all more unhappy on account of her action. \"Poor Wild Irish Girls! they are getting into",

He was within ten feet of me! I took a long breath,\u2014and then said I, \u2018It is now or never.\u2019 I had the coil of the lariat all ready; I paid it out slowly, till it hung right over his head; all of a sudden I let go of the slack, and the slipnoose fell fairly round his neck! Quicker than lightning I out with the Allen and let him have it in the face. It was an awful roar, and must have scared the bull out of his senses. When the smoke cleared away, there he was, dangling in the air, twenty foot from the ground, and going out of one convulsion into another faster than you could count! I didn\u2019t stop to count, anyhow\u2014I shinned down the tree and shot for home.\u201d \u201cBemis, is all that true, just as you have stated it?\u201d \u201cI wish I may rot in my tracks and die the death of a dog if it isn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWell, we can\u2019t refuse to believe it, and we don\u2019t. But if there were some proofs\u2014\u201d \u201cProofs!

I never saw anybody as particular as you are about a little thing like that.\u201d I made up my mind that if this man was not a liar he only missed it by the skin of his teeth. This episode reminds me of an incident of my brief sojourn in Siam,",
    "coherent sentences out of the girl.\" Senator Warfield rode through just behind Lone and reined close, lowering his voice. \"No use in letting this get out,\" he said confidentially. \"It may be that the girl's dementia is some curable nervous disorder, and you know what an injustice it would be if it became noised around that the girl is crazy. How much English does that Swede know?\" \"Not any more than he needs to get along on,\" Lone answered, instinctively on guard. \"He's all right--just a good-natured kinda cuss that wouldn't harm anybody.\" He glanced uneasily at the house, hoping that Lorraine was safe inside, yet fearing that she would not be safe anywhere. Sane or insane, she was in danger if Senator Warfield considered her of sufficient importance to bring him out on horseback to the Quirt ranch. Lone knew how seldom the owner of the Sawtooth rode on horseback since he had high-powered cars to carry him in soft comfort. \"I'll go see if she's home,\" Lone explained, and reined John Doe toward the house. \"I'll go with you,\" Senator Warfield offered suavely and kept alongside. \"Frank Johnson was killed, you say? How did it happen?\" \"Fell off his wagon and broke his neck,\" Lone told him laconically. \"Brit's pretty sick yet; I don't guess you'd better go",
    "severely whenever she found this to be the cause of an afternoon's absence that the girls were slow to offend in this respect. All this Eleanor had heard, among other things, from Edna Wright, but had paid little attention to it when Edna had told her. Directly after cutting Grace Harlowe, she had turned her runabout into Main Street, where a billboard had caught her eye, displaying in glaring red and blue lettering the fact that the \"Peerless Dramatic Company\" would open a week's engagement in Oakdale with daily matin\u00e9es. Eleanor's eyes sparkled. She halted her machine, scanning curiously the list of plays on the billboard. \"The Nihilist's Daughter\" was scheduled for Thursday afternoon, and Eleanor decided to go. She wasn't afraid of Miss Thompson. Then, possessed with a sudden idea, she laughed gleefully. At last she had found a way to effectually annoy the principal. CHAPTER XV A WOULD-BE \"LARK\" Eleanor Savell and the seven girls who formed their sorority were the first to enter the study hall on Tuesday morning. As soon as a girl from any of the three lower classes appeared she was approached by some of the former and a great deal of whispering and subdued laughter went on. A few girls were seen to shake their heads dubiously, and a number of those termed \"grinds\" were not interviewed. The majority, however, appeared to be highly delighted over what they heard, one group standing",

Finally he returned to the pawnbroker\u2019s, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in. \u201cThank you,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cI only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the Strand.\u201d \u201cThird right, fourth left,\u201d answered the assistant promptly, closing the door. \u201cSmart fellow, that,\u201d observed Holmes as we walked away. \u201cHe is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him before.\u201d \u201cEvidently,\u201d said I, \u201cMr. Wilson\u2019s assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him.\u201d \u201cNot him.\u201d \u201cWhat then?\u201d \u201cThe knees of his trousers.\u201d \u201cAnd what did you see?\u201d \u201cWhat I expected to see.\u201d \u201cWhy did you beat the pavement?\u201d \u201cMy dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are spies in an enemy\u2019s country. We know something",
    "part of a summer, but my prescriptions were unlucky, and we appeared to sell more stomach pumps than soda water. So I had to go. 293.jpg (43K) I had made of myself a tolerable printer, under the impression that I would be another Franklin some day, but somehow had missed the connection thus far. There was no berth open in the Esmeralda _Union_, and besides I had always been such a slow compositor that I looked with envy upon the achievements of apprentices of two years\u2019 standing; and when I took a \u201ctake,\u201d foremen were in the habit of suggesting that it would be wanted \u201csome time during the year.\u201d I was a good average St. Louis and New Orleans pilot and by no means ashamed of my abilities in that line; wages were two hundred and fifty dollars a month and no board to pay, and I did long to stand behind a wheel again and never roam any more\u2014but I had been making such an ass of myself lately in grandiloquent letters home about my blind lead and my European excursion that I did what many and many a poor disappointed miner had done before; said \u201cIt is all over with me now, and I will never go back home to be pitied\u2014and snubbed.\u201d I had been a private secretary, a silver miner and a silver mill operative, and amounted to less than nothing in each, and now\u2014 What to do next? I yielded to Higbie\u2019s appeals and consented to try the mining once more. We climbed far up on the mountain side and went to work on a little rubbishy claim of ours that had a shaft on it eight feet deep. Higbie descended into it and worked bravely with his pick till he had loosened up a",
    "even though we have had such a perfectly glorious summer,\" said Jessica Bright. \"We are a notch higher, too. We're actually juniors. This locker-room is now our property, although I don't like it as well as the one we had last year.\" \"We'll get accustomed to it, and it will seem like home inside of two weeks,\" said Anne Pierson philosophically. \"Everything is bound to change in this world, you know. 'We must put ourselves in harmony with the things among which our lot is cast.'\" \"Well, Marcus Aurelius, we'll try to accept your teaching,\" laughed Grace, who immediately recognized the quotation as coming from a tiny \"Marcus Aurelius Year Book\" that Anne kept in her desk and frequently perused. \"I wonder what school will bring us this year?\" mused Nora O'Malley, as she retied her bow for the fifth time before the mirror and critically surveyed the final effect. \"We had a stormy enough time last year, goodness knows. Really, girls, it is hard to believe that Miriam Nesbit and Julia Crosby were at one time the banes of our existence. They come next to you three girls with me, now.\" \"I think that we all feel the same about them,\" replied Grace. \"Miriam is a perfect dear now, and is just as enthusiastic over class matters as we are.\" \"It looks as though everything were going to be plain sailing this year,\" said Jessica. \"There isn't a disturbing element in the class that I know of. Still, one can never tell.\" \"Oh, here come Eva Allen and Marian Barber,\" called Grace delightedly, and rushed over to the newcomers with outstretched hands. By this time girls began to arrive rapidly, and soon the locker-room hummed with the sound of fresh, young voices. Coats of tan were compared and newly acquired freckles",
    "Anne had invited two girls to her house,\" continued Grace. \"Mrs. Gray had planned a party for us, but when we told her what we were about to do, she gave up her party and agreed to go to mine instead, on condition that Anne's family, plus Anne's two guests, should have dinner with her.\" \"Bless her dear heart,\" said David, \"she is always thinking of the pleasure of others. Now about the football game. Bring your girls along and I'll do my best to give them a good time, although I'm generally anything but a success with new girls. However, Hippy makes up for what I lack. He can entertain a regiment of them, and not even exert himself. Now I must leave you, for I have a very important engagement at home.\" \"In the laboratory, I suppose,\" said Anne teasingly. \"Just so,\" replied David. \"Good-bye, girls. Let me know how many tickets you want for the game.\" He raised his cap, mounted his machine and was off down the street. \"It will seem good to have a frolic with the boys again, won't it?\" said Grace to Anne as they strolled along. \"We do seem to be getting awfully serious and settled of late,\" replied Anne. \"Why, this sorority business has taken up all our spare time lately. We've had so many special meetings.\" \"I know it,\" replied Grace, \"but after Thanksgiving we'll only meet once in two weeks, for I must get my basketball team in shape, and you see all the members belong to the society.\" \"You ought to do extra good work this year,\" observed Anne, \"for the team is absolutely harmonious. Last season seems like a dream to me",
    "father. The deep rumble grew louder, nearer. The revealed brilliance became swift sword-thrusts of blinding light that seemed to stab deep the earth. Lorraine ran awkwardly, her hands over her ears, crying out at each lightning flash, her voice drowned in the thunder that followed it close. Then, as she neared the somber group of buildings, the clouds above them split with a terrific, rending crash, and the whole place stood pitilessly revealed to her, as if a spotlight had been turned on. Lorraine stood aghast. The buildings were not buildings at all. They were rocks, great, black, forbidding boulders standing there on a narrow ridge, having a diabolic likeness to houses. The human mind is wonderfully resilient, but readjustment comes slowly after a shock. Dumbly, refusing to admit the significance of what she had seen, Lorraine went forward. Not until she had reached and had touched the first grotesque caricature of habitation did she wholly grasp the fact that she was lost, and that shelter might be miles away. She stood and looked at the orderly group of boulders as the lightning intermittently revealed them. She saw where the road ran on, between two square-faced rocks. She would have to follow the road, for after all it must lead _somewhere_,--to her father's ranch, probably. She wondered irrelevantly why her mother had never mentioned these queer rocks, and she wondered vaguely if any of them had caves or ledges where she could be safe from the lightning. She was on the point of stepping out into the road again when a horseman rode into sight between the two rocks. In the same instant of his appearance she heard the unmistakable crack of a gun, saw the rider jerk backward in the saddle, throw up one hand,--and then the darkness dropped between them. Lorraine crouched behind a juniper bush close",
    "won't have another care nor anxiety; we won't have another wrinkle of trouble as long as we remain in the world.\" Ruth went straight over to the old man, knelt down by his side, and looked into his face. \"Stroke my hair, granddad,\" she said. He raised his trembling hand and placed it on her head. \"That is nice,\" she said, and caught his hand as it went backwards and forwards over her silky black hair, and kissed it. \"Granddad,\" she said after a pause, \"is it the best thing--quite the best thing--always to come out on the right side of the ledger?\" \"Eh? Listen to the little woman,\" said the old man, much pleased and interested by her words. \"Why, of course, Ruth; it is the only thing.\" \"But does it mean sometimes, grandfather--dishonor?\" \"No, it never means that,\" said Mr. Craven gravely and thoughtfully. \"But I will tell you what, Ruthie. It does mean sometimes all you have got.\" \"Yes,\" said Ruth, \"I understand.\" She rose to her feet. Do you think my father would have come out on the right side of the ledger?\" \"Ah, child! when he lay dead on the field of battle he came very much out on the right side, to my thinking. But why that melancholy note in your voice, Ruth? And why are your cheeks so flushed? Is anything the matter?\" \"Kiss me,\" said Ruth. \"I am glad you have said what you did about father. I am more glad than sorry, on the whole, this morning. Good-bye, grandfather.\" She kissed him; then she raised her flower-like head and walked out of the room with a gentle dignity all her own. \"What has come to the little woman?\" thought the old man. But in a minute or two he forgot her, and called to his wife to bring",

    "from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the _Encyclop\u00e6dia_, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay\u2019s ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice\u2019s hair. The \u00a3 4 a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation.\u201d \u201cBut how could you guess what the motive was?\u201d \u201cHad there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man\u2019s business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant\u2019s",
    "\"A handsome old man, too,\" said Mrs. Hopkins, \"but I confess I don't know anything about him.\" \"Well, he and his old wife have got this one beautiful grandchild, and she has joined the foundationers at the Great Shirley School. Miss Kathleen O'Hara has taken up with her as well as with me and other foundation girls, and instead of having a miserable, dull, down-trodden life, we are extremely likely to have the best life of any girls in the school. Anyhow, I have a message for Ruth and I promised to deliver it.\" \"All right, child; don't be longer away than you can help.\" Susy left the house. The distance from her mother's shop to the Cravens' cottage was a matter of ten minutes' quick walking. She soon reached her destination, walked up the little path which led to the tiny cottage, and tapped with her fingers on the door. The door was opened for her by old Mrs. Craven. Mrs. Craven was in her Sunday best, and looked a very beautiful and almost aristocratic old lady. \"Do you want my grandchild?\" she said, observing Susy's size and dress. \"Yes; is she within?\" asked Susy. \"No, dear; she has gone to church. Would you like to wait in for her, or would you rather go and meet her? She has gone to St. James the Less, the church just around the corner; you know it?\" \"Yes, I know it,\" said Susy. \"They'll be coming out now,\" said Mrs. Craven, looking up at the eight-day clock which stood in the passage. \"If you go and stand by the principal entrance, you are safe to see her.\" \"Thank you,\" said Susy. \"You are sure you wouldn't rather wait in the house?\" \"No, really. Mother expects me back. My name is Susan Hopkins. My mother keeps the",
    "something--only, you're not the man I saw--or thought I saw.\" \"No, of course I'm not. You dreamed the whole thing, and the way you talked to me was so wild, folks would say you're crazy if they heard you tell it. You're a stranger here, Miss Hunter, and--your father is not as popular in this country as he might be. He's got enemies that would be glad of the chance to stir up trouble for him. You--just dreamed all that. I'm asking you to forget a bad dream, that's all, and not go telling it to other folks.\" For some time Lorraine did not answer. The horses conversed with sundry nose-rubbings, nibbled idly at convenient brush tips, and wondered no doubt why their riders were so silent. Lone tried to think of some stronger argument, some appeal that would reach the girl without frightening her or causing her to distrust him. But he did not know what more he could say without telling her what must not be told. \"Just how would it make trouble for my father?\" Lorraine asked at last. \"I can't believe you'd ask me to help cover up a crime, but it seems hard to believe that a nightmare would cause any great commotion. And why is my father unpopular?\" \"Well, you don't know this country,\" Lone parried inexpertly. \"It's all right in some ways, and in some ways it could be a lot improved. Folks haven't got much to talk about. They go around gabbling their heads off about every little thing, and adding onto it until you can't recognize your own remarks after they've been peddled for a week. You've maybe seen places like that.\" \"Oh, yes.\" Lorraine's eyes lighted with a smile. \"Take a movie studio, for instance.\" \"Yes. Well, you being a stranger, you would get all the worst of it. I just thought I'd tell you; I'd hate to see you misunderstood by folks around here. I--I feel kinda responsible for you; I'm the one that",
    "pour in sand and gravel and ram it down, then light the fuse and run. When the explosion came and the rocks and smoke shot into the air, we would go back and find about a bushel of that hard, rebellious quartz jolted out. Nothing more. One week of this satisfied me. I resigned. Clagget and Oliphant followed. Our shaft was only twelve feet deep. We decided that a tunnel was the thing we wanted. 212.jpg (89K) So we went down the mountain side and worked a week; at the end of which time we had blasted a tunnel about deep enough to hide a hogshead in, and judged that about nine hundred feet more of it would reach the ledge. I resigned again, and the other boys only held out one day longer. We decided that a tunnel was not what we wanted. We wanted a ledge that was already \u201cdeveloped.\u201d There were none in the camp. We dropped the \u201cMonarch\u201d for the time being. Meantime the camp was filling up with people, and there was a constantly growing excitement about our Humboldt mines.

Still, it is clear that she is not personally threatened.\u201d \u201cNo. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away.\u201d \u201cQuite so. She has her freedom.\u201d \u201cWhat _can_ be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?\u201d \u201cI have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell.\u201d The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance from the station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table. \u201cI am so delighted that you have come,\u201d she said earnestly. \u201cIt is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me.\u201d \u201cPray tell us what has happened to you.\u201d \u201cI will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to be back before three.

    "\"It strikes me it will be all up with us to-morrow--that is, if Ruth tells.\" \"If Ruth tells! What do you mean?\" \"They are going to do their utmost to get her to tell; and if she does tell they will call out our names and expel us, that's all. Oh! I can't bear to think of it--I can't bear to think of it.\" Susy's voice broke. Tears trembled in her bright black eyes, and she turned her head to one side. Kathleen gave her a quick glance. \"It will be all right,\" she said. \"Ruth won't tell. Ruth is the kind who never tells. She told me to-day she wouldn't.\" \"She'll be a brick if she doesn't,\" said Kate Rourke. \"But then, of course, you know--\" \"I know what?\" \"Oh, nothing. What's the good of making ourselves melancholy on a night like this?\" \"If I were expelled,\" said Clara Sawyer, \"I should leave Merrifield. I could never lift up my head again. You can't think what impudent sort of boys my brothers are, and they have always twitted me for my good fortune in getting into the Great Shirley School. They say that if we are to be expelled it will be done in public. The governors are determined to read us a lesson. That's what they say.\" \"Who cares what they say?\" said Kathleen. \"Let them say.\" \"Well, that's what I think; and",
    "in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman\u2019s attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the girl\u2019s affections from turning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady\u2019s mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!\u201d Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face. \u201cIt may be so, or it may not,",
    "which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her, he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the street. \u201cIs the poor gentleman much hurt?\u201d she asked. \u201cHe is dead,\u201d cried several voices. \u201cNo, no, there\u2019s life in him!\u201d shouted another. \u201cBut he\u2019ll be gone before you can get him to hospital.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a brave fellow,\u201d said a woman. \u201cThey would have had the lady\u2019s purse and watch if it hadn\u2019t been for him. They were a gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he\u2019s breathing now.\u201d \u201cHe can\u2019t lie in the street. May",
    "on the joint except the judge and one old servant,\" growled Bill. \"The rest o' the bunch'll be at the weddin' of one o' the girls. I laid low and heard 'em talkin' about it to-day. The judge's got money in the house, too. He always keeps it around, and that old Putnam place is pretty well back from the road.\" Grace waited to hear no more. She had obtained the information she sought. They were going to rob and perhaps murder good old Judge Putnam. Slipping quietly out of the closet, she approached the back door and cautiously took hold of the bolt. To her joy it moved easily. Exercising the greatest care in sliding it back, she lifted the latch. It made no sound, and, holding her breath, she softly swung open the door and ran on tiptoe around the corner of the house. Throwing away her bouquet as she ran, she made for a clump of underbrush at one side of the cottage. Here she paused, and hearing no disturbance from inside, she continued her flight. But she had lost her sense of direction, and after fifteen minutes' wandering was about to despair of finding her way, when she espied the honeysuckle bush that she had stripped earlier in the afternoon. This put her on the right track, but she was farther away from the picnic grounds than she had supposed, and when tired and breathless she at last reached them, it was only to find them deserted. The party had gone back to town without her. Grace stood staring about her in blank dismay. It was nearing seven o'clock, and she was twelve miles from Oakdale. Why hadn't the girls waited? Grace felt ready to cry, then the vision of the poor old judge, alone and at the mercy of the two ruffians, flashed before her. \"I'll walk to Oakdale,\" she said, with a determined nod of her head. \"And I'll not stop for an instant until I notify the police.\" Grace never forgot that lonely walk. The darkness of a moonless night",

Wherefore it is an abridgment of the record of the people of Nephi, and also of the Lamanites; written to the Lamanites, who are a remnant of the House of Israel; and also to Jew and Gentile; written by way of commandment, and also by the spirit of prophecy and of revelation.

    "originals to work out, and Nora hated originals. When the bell rang at the close of the hour, Eleanor walked haughtily by Miss Ames, giving her a contemptuous look as she passed that made the teacher tighten her lips and look severe. Grace, who was directly behind her, saw both the look and the expression on the teacher's face. She felt worried for Eleanor's sake, because she saw trouble ahead for her unless she changed her tactics. If Eleanor could only understand that she must respect the authority of her various teachers during recitation hours and cheerfully comply with their requests, then all might be well. Since Miss Leece had left the High School at the close of Grace's freshman year, she could not conscientiously say that she disliked any of her teachers. They had been both kind and just, and if Eleanor defied them openly, then she would have to take the consequences. To be sure, Eleanor might refuse to go to school, but Grace had an idea that, lenient as Miss Nevin was with her niece, she would not allow Eleanor to go that far. Grace decided that she would have a talk with Eleanor after school. It would do no harm and it might possibly do some good. She hurried down to the locker-room that afternoon in order to catch Eleanor as she left school. She had just reached there when Eleanor walked in, looking extremely sulky. She jerked her hat and coat from her",
    "thought you could ride. I seen how you piled onto old Yellowjacket and the way you held your reins. It runs in the blood, I guess. I'll see what I can do in the way of a horse. Ole Yellowjacket used to be a real rim-rider, but he's gitting old; gitting old--same as me.\" \"You're not! You're just letting yourself _feel_ old. And am I one of the outfit, dad?\" \"I guess so--only there ain't going to be any of this hell-whoopin' stuff, Raine. You can't travel these trails at a long lope with yore hair flyin' out behind and--and all that damn foolishness. I've saw 'em in the movin' pitchers----\" Lorraine blushed, and was thankful that her dad had not watched her work in that serial. For that matter, she hoped that Lone Morgan would never stray into a movie where any of her pictures were being shown. \"I'm serious, dad. I don't want to make a show of myself. But if you'll feel that I can be a help instead of a handicap, that's what I want. And if it comes to fighting----\" Brit pushed her from him impatiently. \"There yuh go--fight--fight--and I told yuh there ain't any fighting going on. Nothing more'n a fight to hang on and make a living. That means straight, hard work and mindin' your own business. If you want to help at that----\" \"I do,\" said Raine quietly, getting to her feet. Her legacy of stubbornness set her lips firmly together. \"That's exactly what I mean. Good night, dad.\" Brit answered her noncommittally, apparently sunk already in his own musings. But his lips drew in to suppress a smile when he saw, from the corner of his eyes, that Lorraine was winding the alarm on the cheap kitchen clock, and that she set the hand carefully and took the clock with her to bed. CHAPTER NINE THE",
    "would quit, she asserted indignantly. She thought the director had better go back to driving a laundry wagon, which was probably where he came from. Lone agreed with her, even though he did not know what she was talking about. He walked as fast as he could, but even so he could not travel the six miles to the ranch very quickly. He could see that the girl was burning up with fever, and he could hear her voice growing husky,--could hear, too, the painful laboring of her breath. When she was not mumbling incoherent nonsense she was laughing hoarsely at the plight she was in, and after that she would hold both hands to her chest and moan in a way that made Lone grind his teeth. When he lifted her off his horse at the foreman's cottage she was whispering things no one could understand. Three cowpunchers came running and hindered him a good deal in carrying her into the house, and the foreman's wife ran excitedly from one room to the other, asking questions and demanding that some one do something \"for pity's sake, she may be dying for all you know, while you stand there gawping like fool-hens.\" \"She was out all night in the rain--got lost, somehow. She said she was coming here, so I brought her on. She's down with a cold, Mrs. Hawkins. Better take off them wet clothes and put hot blankets around her. And a poultice or something on her chest, I reckon.\" Lone turned to the door, stopped to roll a cigarette, and watched Mrs. Hawkins hurrying to Lorraine with a whisky toddy the cook had mixed for her. \"A sweat's awful good for a cold like she's got,\" he volunteered practically. \"She's out of her head--or she was when I found her. But I reckon that's mostly scare, from being",
    "and yet so \u201cslow,\u201d so sleepy; such an insipid mess of inspiration. It is chloroform in print. If Joseph Smith composed this book, the act was a miracle\u2014keeping awake while he did it was, at any rate. If he, according to tradition, merely translated it from certain ancient and mysteriously-engraved plates of copper, which he declares he found under a stone, in an out-of-the-way locality, the work of translating was equally a miracle, for the same reason. The book seems to be merely a prosy detail of imaginary history, with the Old Testament for a model; followed by a tedious plagiarism of the New Testament. The author labored to give his words and phrases the quaint, old-fashioned sound and structure of our King James\u2019s translation of the Scriptures; and the result is a mongrel\u2014half modern glibness, and half ancient simplicity and gravity. The latter is awkward and constrained; the former natural, but grotesque by the contrast. Whenever he found his speech growing too modern\u2014which was about every sentence or two\u2014he ladled in a few such Scriptural phrases as \u201cexceeding sore,\u201d \u201cand it came to pass,\u201d etc., and made things satisfactory again. \u201cAnd it came to pass\u201d was his pet.

Ruth Craven in particular had several. \"I don't think that is a very fair rule,\" she said. \"I am fond of Alice Tennant, and I am fond of Cassandra Weldon.\" \"And I care for Lucy Sharp\"; \"And I am devoted to Amelia Dawson,\" said other members of the Cabinet. Nevertheless Kathleen was firm. \"The rule must be held,\" she said. \"In a society like ours there are always rules which are not quite agreeable to every one. My principal object in starting this society is to put those horrid paying girls in their proper places. There must not be friendship--not real friendship, I mean--between us and them.\" \"You are a paying girl yourself,\" suddenly exclaimed Mary Rand. \"I know. I wish I were not, but I can't help myself. You must allow me to stand alone; I am your queen.\" \"That you are, and I love you,\" said Mary. \"This rule must hold good,\" repeated Kathleen. \"I must insist on my society adhering to it.--Ruth Craven, why are you silent?\" \"Because I earnestly wish I had not joined. I cannot give up Cassandra, nor Alice, nor--nor other girls.\" \"Nonsense, Ruth! You dare not fail me now,\" said Kathleen, with enthusiasm. \"I will make it up to you. You shall come with me to Ireland in the summer. You shall. Oh Ruth, don't fail me!\" \"I won't; but I hate that rule.\" \"And, girls, I think we must part now,\" said Kate Rourke. \"It is getting late,",

(We beat that, however, two days afterward when we made twenty-seven miles in twenty-seven minutes, while our Champagne glasses filled to the brim spilled not a drop!) After dinner we repaired to our drawing-room car, and, as it was Sabbath eve, intoned some of the grand old hymns\u2014\u201cPraise God from whom,\u201d etc.; \u201cShining Shore,\u201d \u201cCoronation,\u201d etc.\u2014the voices of the men singers and of the women singers blending sweetly in the evening air, while our train, with its great, glaring Polyphemus eye, lighting up long vistas of prairie, rushed into the night and the Wild.

Another night of alternate tranquillity and turmoil. But morning came, by and by. It was another glad awakening to fresh breezes, vast expanses of level greensward, bright sunlight, an impressive solitude utterly without visible human beings or human habitations, and an atmosphere of such amazing magnifying properties that trees that seemed close at hand were more than three mile away. We resumed undress uniform, climbed a- top of the flying coach, dangled our legs over the side, shouted occasionally at",
    "they made their way to the grandstand. \"It ended very sensationally for me.\" \"I should say it did,\" replied David, smiling. \"Confidentially, Anne, do you ever hear from your father?\" \"Not very often,\" replied Anne. \"He is not liable to trouble me again, however, because he knows that I will not go back to the stage, no matter what he says. He was with the western company of 'True Hearts' last year, but I don't know where he is now, and I don't care. Don't think I'm unfeeling; but it is impossible for me to care for him, even though he is my father.\" \"I understand,\" said David sympathetically. \"Now let's forget him and have a good time.\" \"Hurrah! Here comes the band!\" shouted Hippy. The \"Oakdale Military Band\" took their places in the improvised bandstand and began a short concert before the game with the \"Stars and Stripes,\" while the spectators unconsciously kept time with their feet to the inspiring strains. When the two teams appeared on the field there were shouts of enthusiasm from the friends of the players, and the band burst forth with the High School song, in which the students joined. After the usual preliminaries, the game began, and for the next hour everything",

Besides, Miss Thompson is going to speak.\" The principal held up her hand for silence and the groups of girls engaged in subdued conversation ceased talking and turned their attention toward her. \"You are all aware that each year the senior class gives a play, which they choose, manage and produce with no assistance save that given by Miss Tebbs,\" said the principal. \"So far the three lower classes have never given a play. Some time ago Miss Tebbs suggested that as we need money for special books in the library which our yearly appropriation does not cover, we might present a Shakespearian play with good effect, choosing the cast from the freshman, sophomore and junior classes. \"The first thing to be thought of is the play itself. After due consideration, we decided that 'As You Like It' is better suited to our needs than any of the other Shakespearian dramas. In it are twenty-one speaking characters, besides numerous lords, pages and attendants. We shall probably use about fifty",
    "One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate. \u201cYesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the name, for it was that of none other than\u2014well, perhaps even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth\u2014one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task. \u201c\u2018Mr. Holder,\u2019 said he, \u2018I have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money.\u2019 \u201c\u2018The firm does so when the security is good.\u2019 I answered. \u201c\u2018It is absolutely essential to me,\u2019 said he, \u2018that I should have \u00a3 50,000 at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one\u2019s self under obligations.\u2019 \u201c\u2018For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?\u2019 I asked. \u201c\u2018Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once.\u2019 \u201c\u2018I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse,\u2019 said I,",
    "a sheet of paper from her notebook and wrote: \"DEAR ELEANOR: \"The members of the Phi Sigma Tau are very sorry about your having to make an apology. We did not wish it. We think you showed a great deal of the right kind of courage in making the public apology you did both to Miss Thompson and to us. Won't you come back to the Phi Sigma Tau? \"YOUR SINCERE FRIENDS.\" At recess Grace showed the note to her friends. She had signed her name to the note and requested the others to do the same. Here she met with some opposition. Nora, Marian Barber and Eva Allen were strongly opposed to sending it. But Jessica, Anne and Miriam agreed with Grace that it would be in fulfillment of the original promise to Mrs. Gray to help Eleanor whenever they could do so. So the Phi Sigma Tau signed their names and the note was passed to Eleanor directly after recess. She opened it, read it through, and an expression of such intense scorn passed over her face that Nora, who sat near her and who was covertly watching her, knew at once that Grace's flag of truce had been trampled in the dust. Picking up her pen, Eleanor wrote rapidly for a brief space, underlined what she had written, signed her name with a flourish, and, folding and addressing her note, sent it to Grace. Rather surprised at receiving an answer so quickly, Grace unfolded the note. Then she colored, looked grave and, putting the note in the back of the text-book she was holding, went on studying. By the time school was over for the day, the girls of the Phi Sigma Tau knew that Eleanor had once more repudiated their overtures of friendship and were curious to see what she had written. \"Don't keep us in suspense. Let us",
    "we'll have to find her. Lone, can you come and help?\" \"The Swede and me'll both help,\" Lone volunteered. \"Jim and Sorry can wait here for the coroner. We ought to find her without any trouble, much. Swan, I'll get you that tobacco first and see if Brit needs anything.\" He started to the house, and Swan followed him aimlessly, his long strides bringing him close to Lone before they reached the door. \"What do you make of this new play?\" Lone muttered cautiously when he saw Swan's shadow move close to his own. \"By golly, it's something funny about it. You stick with them, Loney, and find out. I'm taking Al's trail with Yack. You fix it.\" And he added whimsically, \"Not so much tobacco, Lone. I don't eat it or smoke it ever in my life.\" His voice was very Swedish, which was fortunate, because Senator Warfield appeared softly behind him and went into the house. Swan was startled, but he hadn't much time to worry over the possibility of having been overheard. Brit's voice rose in a furious denunciation of Bill Warfield, punctuated by two shots and followed almost immediately by the senator. \"My God, the whole family's crazy!\" Warfield exclaimed, when he had reached the safety of the open air. \"You're right, Lone. I thought I'd be neighborly enough to ask what I could do for him, and he tried to kill me!\" Lone merely grunted and gave Swan the tobacco. CHAPTER EIGHTEEN \"I THINK AL WOODRUFF'S GOT HER\"",
    "and why the killer's plans had gone awry. She was certain that she and Swan had prevented him from climbing down into the canyon and making sure that her dad did not live to tell what mischance had overtaken him. He had probably been watching while she and Swan made that stretcher and carried her dad away out of his reach. He would not shoot _her_,--he would not dare. Nor would he dare come to the cabin and finish the job he had begun. But he had managed to kill Frank--poor old Frank, who would never grumble and argue over little things again. There was nothing picturesque, nothing adventurous about it. It was just straight, heart-breaking tragedy, that had its sordid side too. Her dad was a querulous sick man absorbed by his sufferings and not yet out of danger, if she read the doctor's face aright. Jim and Sorry had taken orders all their life, and they would not be able to handle the ranch work alone; yet how else would it be done? There was Lone,--instinctively she turned her thoughts to him for comfort. Lone would stay and help, and somehow it would be managed. But to think that these things could be done without fear of retribution. Jim and Sorry, Swan and Lone had not attempted to hide their belief that the Sawtooth was responsible for Frank's death, yet not one of them had hinted at the possibility of calling the sheriff, or placing the blame where it belonged. They seemed brow-beaten into the belief that it would be useless to fight back. They seemed to look upon the",
    "a mourner, occupied a prominent place at the funeral, and when the sermon was finished and the last sentence of the prayer for the dead man\u2019s soul ascended, he responded, in a low voice, but with feelings: \u201cAMEN. No Irish need apply.\u201d As the bulk of the response was without apparent relevancy, it was probably nothing more than a humble tribute to the memory of the friend that was gone; for, as Scotty had once said, it was \u201chis word.\u201d Scotty Briggs, in after days, achieved the distinction of becoming the only convert to religion that was ever gathered from the Virginia roughs; and it transpired that the man who had it in him to espouse the quarrel of the weak out of inborn nobility of spirit was no mean timber whereof to construct a Christian. The making him one did not warp his generosity or diminish his courage; on the contrary it gave intelligent direction to the one and a broader field to the other. If his Sunday-school class progressed faster than the other classes, was it matter for wonder? I think not. He talked to his pioneer small-fry in a language they understood! It was my large privilege,",
    "California thirteen times by stage and listened to that deathless incident four hundred and eighty-one or eighty-two times. I have the list somewhere. Drivers always told it, conductors told it, landlords told it, chance passengers told it, the very Chinamen and vagrant Indians recounted it. I have had the same driver tell it to me two or three times in the same afternoon. It has come to me in all the multitude of tongues that Babel bequeathed to earth, and flavored with whiskey, brandy, beer, cologne, sozodont, tobacco, garlic, onions, grasshoppers\u2014everything that has a fragrance to it through all the long list of things that are gorged or guzzled by the sons of men. I never have smelt any anecdote as often as I have smelt that one; never have smelt any anecdote that smelt so variegated as that one. And you never could learn to know it by its smell, because every time you thought you had learned the smell of it, it would turn up with a different smell. Bayard Taylor has written about this hoary anecdote, Richardson has published it; so have Jones, Smith, Johnson, Ross Browne, and every other correspondence-inditing being that ever set his foot upon the great overland road anywhere between Julesburg and San Francisco; and I have heard that it is in the Talmud. I have seen it in print in nine different foreign languages; I have been told that it is employed in the inquisition in Rome; and I now learn with regret that it is going to be set to music. I do not think that such things are right. Stage-coaching on the Overland is no more, and stage drivers are a race defunct. I wonder if they bequeathed that bald-headed anecdote to their successors, the railroad brakemen and conductors, and if these latter still persecute the helpless passenger with it until he concludes, as did many a tourist of other days, that the real grandeurs of the Pacific coast are not Yo Semite and the Big"
