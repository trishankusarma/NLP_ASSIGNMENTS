    "morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, \u201cit was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the _Encyclop\u00e6dia_, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. \u201cI felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Remember the card upon the bird\u2019s leg.\u201d \u201cYou have an answer to everything. \u201c\u2018That will do,\u2019 said he; \u2018I could not ask for anything better. Oh, Heaven bless you!\u201d \u201cNo more words. \u201cI thought as much,\u201d said he. Now we can talk in safety.\u2019 He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look. The facts are these: about four o\u2019clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. \u201cThere are a thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course of action.

Hustle, everybody.\" As they hurried along the path a blast of wind blew full in their faces. I feel sure that under the circumstances the absent members of both classes would agree with us if they were present. \"I shall be eaten up with curiosity until school closes.\" \"Wish to goodness it was over now,\" growled Nora O'Malley. \"You are the child of the sorority now, Mabel,\" said Miriam Nesbit, \"and we are your adopted mothers. \"We wish to ask your advice about something.\" \"I am at your service,\" said Jessica's father, making her an elaborate bow. Our object will be to enjoy ourselves, not to continually preach to other people. It isn't pleasant to admit that we have failed with Eleanor, but it isn't our fault, at any rate. \"I think I'll go into the wings. About one third of the girls arose and prepared to leave the study hall, the Phi Sigma Tau being among the number. I am sorry you found out about it, because it has spoiled all our fun.\" There was a gasp of horror at Eleanor's assertion. 4 THE SUBMARINE BOYS AND THE SPIES; Or, Dodging the Sharks of the Deep. Grace nodded sympathetically, but went home with an uneasy feeling that playing the guardian angel to Eleanor would be anything but a light task. She and Miriam had won against worthy opponents. \"I move we post a notice in the locker-room and have a meeting to-morrow after school. \"Command me as you will.\" \"'Tis well, most reverend sir. \"But I adore idols,\" persisted Hippy.

Clair, the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is over.\u201d \u201cBut he must be alive, Mr. I have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. An examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. But if you have, why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures? I give you my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.\u201d \u201cI am glad to hear you say so,\u201d said Holmes gravely. This is my point.\u201d He placed his finger in the centre of the circle.

Ermengarde had an idea that if she had been like any other little girl, she might have suddenly burst out sobbing and crying. \"Sara,\" she said, \"your papa's solicitor, Mr. \"She has gone out with her basket and may be gone for hours. \"I did not expect to see you tonight, Ermie,\" Sara said. \"Lavinia,\" with a new giggle, \"what do you think Gertrude says?\" \"I don't know, I'm sure; and I don't care if it's something more about that everlasting Sara.\" \"Well, it is. \"Who was he?\" asked Ermengarde, looking at it quite as if it had not been a mere ordinary silver sixpence. It has a vaulted roof, and a minstrels' gallery, and a huge chimney filled with blazing oaken logs, and it is brilliant with waxen tapers twinkling on every side.\" \"My eye, Miss Sara!\" gasped Becky again. I thought--perhaps--you might like a piece of cake.\" The next ten minutes seemed to Becky like a sort of delirium. It became apparent that she boxed Becky's ears. She tried to begin a smile, and somehow she could not. Her manners--which have caused you to call her Princess Sara--are perfect. If the children were not attentive, if they talked, if they were restless, it was she who would be reproved. \"And Sara is too thin.\" Naturally, Jessie giggled again. \"Miss Minchin's tables and chairs are just like her,\" she thought; \"I remember thinking that the first minute I saw her, even though I was so little. It took Sara a few seconds to control herself sufficiently to remember that she was a princess. You can do that with people you never speak to at all. Poor plump Miss Amelia was trying first one method, and then another. She was a forlorn little thing",

You know she understudies Anne. \"There isn't a disturbing element in the class that I know of. There was a burst of laughter from the girls at this effusion, in which Nora herself joined. When she reached Putnam Square she almost ran along the broad asphalt walk. Perhaps if they are still living you will find them some day.'\" \"That is about all we need,\" said Grace, as she folded the letter and put it back in the envelope. \"That is why I have told you this.

When the packages were unfolded Miss Minchin's countenance wore suddenly a singular expression. Don't you know that Sara is your mamma? \"I believe you are thinner than you used to be. When Sara had stirred ever so faintly, Ram Dass had closed the lantern-slide and lain flat upon the floor. \"Sometimes I'm a bit frightened of her.\" \"Ridiculous thing!\" ejaculated Lavinia. You haven't a street-beggar face.\" \"A little boy once gave me a sixpence for charity,\" said Sara, with a short little laugh in spite of herself. Sara curled herself up in the window-seat, opened a book, and began to read. \"What WERE they?\" \"Diamond mines,\" answered Mr. I'm covered with mud now. The truth, indeed, was that Miss Minchin knew that she was too anxious to learn to require teachers. She looked Miss Minchin steadily in the face. You remember she made none when Captain Crewe went back to India. I asked my Magic, and it told me to go and look.\" \"But oh, miss,\" cried Becky, \"wait till she's told you what they are!

I think you'll like it, Mr. Rand, how much do you think it ought to bring?\" Rand shook his head. Tell you what; I'll call a meeting at my place tomorrow evening, say at eight thirty. Fleming was, and he began wishing him out of the way. And before that ...\" \"Oh, forget it.\" Rand dismissed Geraldine with a shrug. \"I want you to come here and get a room at the Rosemont Inn, under your own name. \"If you don't mind, Pierre, I think I'll go home.\" \"I'm not feeling very festive, myself, right now.\" The ex-Marine rose and held out his hand to Rand. Here; I'll pay you a thousand down, and two more when you have the case completed; I want you to get the murder cleared up before I can be publicly involved in it.

Therefore, as I'm not afraid of angle worms, I'm going to dig some bait and fish. \"We will go, but we shall take Miss Mabel with us. I'm afraid that it's all a dream and that I'll wake up and find her standing over me. Of course we know very little about her yet, but I think she will prove worthy. She was talking animatedly and her two friends were apparently hanging on every word she uttered. \"I didn't know there was a house anywhere near here. However, you folks are equally guilty, you've all gone mad over your sorority, and left Hippy and Reddy and me to wander about Oakdale like lost souls. \"How serious you girls are,\" she said. 4 THE RANGE AND GRANGE HUSTLERS AT CHICAGO; Or, The Conspiracy of the Wheat Pit. Grilling on the Football Gridiron.

When the King was coming towards this place on his way to England, a wily French Lord, called the Count of Ch\u00e2lons, sent him a polite challenge to come with his knights and hold a fair tournament with the Count and _his_ knights, and make a day of it with sword and lance. Such a servant as he, to such a master as Henry, would probably have fallen in any case; but, between the hatred of the party of the Queen that was, and the hatred of the party of the Queen that was to be, he fell suddenly and heavily. To restrain the growing power of Strongbow, he himself repaired to Dublin, as Strongbow\u2019s Royal Master, and deprived him of his kingdom, but confirmed him in the enjoyment of great possessions. The poor persecuted country people believed that the New Forest was enchanted. The Pope, hearing the whole story, declared that neither election would do for him, and that _he_ elected Stephen Langton. Now, it had cost the Prince a good deal of money to pay soldiers to support this murderous King; and finding himself, when he came back disgusted to Bordeaux, not only in bad health, but deeply in debt, he began to tax his French subjects to pay his creditors.

Edgar himself was not important enough for anybody to care much about him. An inventory was made out of all the riches in his palace at York Place (now Whitehall), and he went sorrowfully up the river, in his barge, to Putney. They set him down in mock state on an ant-hill, and twisted grass about his head, and pretended to pay court to him on their knees, saying, \u2018O King, without a kingdom, and Prince without a people, we hope your gracious Majesty is very well and happy!\u2019 They did worse than this; they cut his head off, and handed it on a pole to the Queen, who laughed with delight when she saw it (you recollect their walking so religiously and comfortably to St. Perkin Warbeck kept quiet for three years; but, as the Flemings began to complain heavily of the loss of their trade by the stoppage of the Antwerp market on his account, and as it was not unlikely that they might even go so far as to take his life, or give him up, he found it necessary to do something. \u2018What will he give to my friend the King of Norway?\u2019 asked the brother. For twenty days, the Archbishop of Canterbury defended that city against its Danish besiegers; and when a traitor in the town threw the gates open and admitted them, he said, in chains, \u2018I will not buy my life",

When Miss Minchin came out and saw her, she looked rather annoyed. You never seem even to have heard her real name.\" \"He used to call her by an odd pet name he had invented. Pretend there is a minstrel gallery up there in the corner. Sara flew across the room and, kneeling down, put her arms round her. One evening a very funny thing happened--though, perhaps, in one sense it was not a funny thing at all. \"Your clothes are a little queer--but you couldn't look like a street beggar. What wouldn't I give to have her little arms round my neck this minute! Don't you think so?\" \"He might not have spoken of it definitely. John's amazement one must recall that a new pupil is, for a short time, a somewhat uncertain thing; and of this new pupil the entire school had talked the night before until it fell asleep quite exhausted by excitement and contradictory stories. She turned to the Lascar, feeling glad that she remembered still some of the Hindustani she had learned when she lived with her father. \"Sara, Sa--ra!\" \"If she doesn't stop, Miss Minchin will hear her,\" cried Jessie. \"No, mum,\" Becky protested, bobbing curtsies. \"And now you've lost her,\" she cried wildly; \"and some other school will get her and her money; and if she were like any other child she'd tell how she's",

Merryweather as we followed them from the cellar, \u201cI do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. I shall call with the King to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret\u2014the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one.

Goode and Dunmore sat together on the sofa, forming what looked like a bilateral offensive and defensive alliance, and Varcek, looking more than ever like Rudolf Hess, stood with folded arms in one corner. The guy at the drive-in made a positive identification; it's the one he sold Fleming. \"Who else?\" \"There's a commission-dealer named Carl Gwinnett, who wants to handle the collection for us, for twenty per cent. I threw my cigar away when I got out of the car, and I didn't light another one till I got home. \"Odd he didn't mention this telephone thing.... \"About two years ago,\" Rand said. Not the sources mentioned above.\" \"Jeff, you know, this damned thing's worrying me,\" Cabot told him, writing a receipt and exchanging it for Rand's check. Not content with that, he's been cleaning it out. Passing the little antique shop he slowed, backed, read the name \"Karen Lawrence\" on the window, and then pulled over to the curb and got out. \"The way I see it, everybody who's within a light-year of this Rivers killing is trying to pin the medal on somebody else,\" Ritter was saying.

It was about to be let down, in its Royal robes, into a tomb near the high altar, in presence of a great concourse of people, when a loud voice in the crowd cried out, \u2018This ground is mine! Tables and chairs were curiously carved in different woods; were sometimes decorated with gold or silver; sometimes even made of those precious metals. The King might possibly have made such a will; or, having always been fond of the Normans, he might have encouraged Norman William to aspire to the English crown, by something that he said to him when he was staying at the English court. Day then appearing, he gave the word (still, of course, in that bruised and aching state) Forward! Therefore there was great rejoicing when he married the Princess Catherine, and when they were both crowned. CHAPTER XXIV ENGLAND",

Gray.\" \"Come in, Grace, and tell us where you found Anne's costumes,\" said Nora, giving her cheeks a final rub. \"I saw him in 'Hamlet' and his acting is wonderful.\" \"No wonder you were surprised,\" said Grace. She won the prize the year before, you know.\" The girl nodded, but she could not sufficiently control herself to speak.

It was you who were different after I came back.\" Sara thought a moment. Some odd materials of rich colors had been fastened against the wall with fine, sharp tacks--so sharp that they could be pressed into the wood and plaster without hammering. \"You were tired,\" she said; \"you could not help it. \"Yes, 'm; I will, 'm,\" she said, trembling; \"but oh, I just wanted to arst you: Miss Sara--she's been such a rich young lady, an' she's been waited on, 'and and foot; an' what will she do now, mum, without no maid?

What would HE say if he knew where you are tonight?\" Something she saw in Sara's grave, fixed gaze at this moment made her turn on her fiercely. She felt it dangling over her ear, and tried wildly to put it straight. You can't sneer back at people like that--if you are a princess. I have short black hair and green eyes; besides which, I am a thin child and not fair in the least. Ram Dass hastily took the precaution of shutting the skylight, and then went in chase of him.

I didn't like that accident, at the time, but I figured he'd pulled the Dutch, and the family were making out it was an accident. But here; if your stepdaughters are co-owners, what's my status?

He looked his visitor over carefully from the doorway, decided that he was not soliciting magazine subscriptions or selling Fuller brushes, and came down the steps.

Plague and famine succeeded in England; and still the powerless King and his disdainful Lords were always in contention. However, he set these things right in the end, by hanging some men and seizing on the rich possessions of others; by granting more popular pardons to the followers of the late King than could, at first, be got from him; and, by employing about his Court, some very scrupulous persons who had been employed in the previous reign. The Earl of Northumberland surrendered himself soon after hearing of the death of his son, and received a pardon for all his offences. For a long time afterwards, the Scottish peasantry used to believe that their King had not been really killed in this battle, because no Englishman had found an iron belt he wore about his body as a penance for having been an unnatural and undutiful son.
